   abstract = {Two human Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines (HBL-4 and HBL-5) were established
individually from two patients with small noncleaved cell lymphoma
(Burkitt's type). The HBL-4 cell line is Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative,
and the HBL-5 cell line is EBV-positive. Cytogenetically, both cell
lines had the same chromosomal translocation, t(8;14)(q24;q32) as
those observed in the primary malignant cells from individual patients.
Morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular studies
confirmed that both cell lines were derived from the primary lymphoma
cells in vivo. HBL-4 cells lacked CD23(H107), CD11a(LFA-1), and latent
membrane protein (LMP) but expressed CD54(ICAM-1) at low levels,
whereas HBL-5 cells showed the high level of expression of CD54 and
faint expression of LMP but lacked CD11a. In addition, the EBV-positive
lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) expressed CD11a, CD23, CD54, and LMP
at high levels. Therefore, an HBL-5 phenotype with expression of
CD54 and LMP tends toward an LCL phenotype, and the augmentation
of CD54 on the HBL-5 cells in comparison with primary lymphoma cells
is likely to be upregulated by LMP, probably resulting from the EBV
infection. There was little difference in the BrdUrd uptake in vivo
and in vitro, doubling time, tumorigenicity, and dynamics of tumor
growth in athymic nude mice between both cell lines. These findings
indicate that the potentiality of cell growth and tumorigenicity
of these two cell lines are unlikely to be related with EBV.},

   abstract = {Abstract An unresolved controversy regarding social behaviors is exemplified
when natural selection might lead to behaviors that maximize fitness
at the social-group level but are costly at the individual level.
Except for the special case of groups of clones, we do not have a
general understanding of how and when group-optimal behaviors evolve,
especially when the behaviors in question are flexible. To address
this question, we develop a general model that integrates behavioral
plasticity in social interactions with the action of natural selection
in structured populations. We find that group-optimal behaviors can
evolve, even without clonal groups, if individuals exhibit appropriate
behavioral responses to each other's actions. The evolution of such
behavioral responses, in turn, is predicated on the nature of the
proximate behavioral mechanisms. We model a particular class of proximate
mechanisms, prosocial preferences, and find that such preferences
evolve to sustain maximum group benefit under certain levels of relatedness
and certain ecological conditions. Thus, our model demonstrates the
fundamental interplay between behavioral responses and relatedness
in determining the course of social evolution. We also highlight
the crucial role of proximate mechanisms such as prosocial preferences
in the evolution of behavioral responses and in facilitating evolutionary
transitions in individuality.},

   abstract = {All cancers are caused by somatic mutations; however, understanding
of the biological processes generating these mutations is limited.
The catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the
signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative.
Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted
more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in
many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the APOBEC family
of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer
class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient
at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA
maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these
genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small
genomic regions, 'kataegis', is found in many cancer types. The results
reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development
of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer
aetiology, prevention and therapy.},

   abstract = {Abstract Evolutionary dynamics depend critically on a population's
interaction structure---the pattern of which individuals interact
with which others, depending on the state of the population and the
environment. Previous research has shown, for example, that cooperative
behaviors disfavored in well-mixed populations can be favored when
interactions occur only between spatial neighbors or group members.
Combining the adaptive dynamics approach with recent advances in
evolutionary game theory, we here introduce a general mathematical
framework for analyzing the long-term evolution of continuous game
strategies for a broad class of evolutionary models, encompassing
many varieties of interaction structure. Our main result, the canonical
equation of adaptive dynamics with interaction structure, characterizes
expected evolutionary trajectories resulting from any such model,
thereby generalizing a central tool of adaptive dynamics theory.
Interestingly, the effects of different interaction structures and
update rules on evolutionary trajectories are fully captured by just
two real numbers associated with each model, which are independent
of the considered game. The first, a structure coefficient, quantifies
the effects on selection pressures and thus on the shapes of expected
evolutionary trajectories. The second, an effective population size,
quantifies the effects on selection responses and thus on the expected
rates of adaptation. Applying our results to two social dilemmas,
we show how the range of evolutionarily stable cooperative behaviors
systematically varies with a model's structure coefficient.},

   abstract = {Existing and emerging pathogens pose unusual challenges for conservation
because of their potential to drive rapid changes in the numerical
abundance and genetic composition of wild host populations. An increasing
number of studies indicate that host genetic diversity plays an important
role in buffering populations against widespread epidemics, and that
parasites represent powerful selective agents in natural populations.
The observation that infectious diseases might be both mitigated
by and rapidly change the genetic composition of host populations
gives new significance to the role of host genetic diversity in species
conservation. Less clear is the role that pathogen evolutionary change
plays in the emergence and spread of new diseases, but recent examples
indicate that humans might be selecting unknowingly for rapid changes
in pathogen biology through habitat fragmentation, climate shifts
and environmental pollution. Although the risks they pose to endangered
species are apparent, pathogens and other natural enemies can be
a driving force behind species and genetic diversity in natural populations,
and preserving interacting networks of coevolving populations should
enable hosts to respond better to future disease threats.},

   abstract = {We review the theory of public goods in biology. In the N-person prisoner's
dilemma, where the public good is a linear function of the individual
contributions, cooperation requires some form of assortment, for
example due to kin discrimination, population viscosity or repeated
interactions. In most social species ranging from bacteria to humans,
however, public goods are usually a non-linear function of the contributions,
which makes cooperation possible without assortment. More specifically,
a polymorphic state can be stable in which cooperators and non-cooperators
coexist. The existence of mixed equilibria in public goods games
is a fundamental result in the study of cooperation that has been
overlooked so far, because of the disproportionate attention given
to the two- and N-person prisoner's dilemma. Methods and results
from games with pairwise interactions or linear benefits cannot,
in general, be extended to the analysis of public goods. Game theory
helps explain the production of public goods in one-shot, N-person
interactions without assortment, it leads to predictions that can
be easily tested and allows a prescriptive approach to cooperation.},

   abstract = {Typical Burkitt lymphoma is characterized by an IG-MYC translocation and overall low genomic complexity. Clinically, Burkitt lymphoma has a favourable prognosis with very few relapses. However, the few patients experiencing disease progression and/or relapse have a dismal outcome. Here we report cytogenetic findings of seven cases of Burkitt lymphoma in which sequential karyotyping was performed at time of diagnosis and/or disease progression/relapse(s). After case selection, karyotype re-review and additional molecular analyses were performed in six paediatric cases, treated in Berlin-Frankfurt-M{\"u}nster-Non-Hodgkin lymphoma study group trials, and one additional adult patient. Moreover, we analysed 18 cases of Burkitt lymphoma from the Mitelman database in which sequential karyotyping was performed. Our findings show secondary karyotypes to have a significant increase in load of cytogenetic aberrations with a mean number of 2, 5 and 8 aberrations for primary, secondary and third investigations. Importantly, this increase in karyotype complexity seemed to result from recurrent secondary chromosomal changes involving mainly trisomy 21, gains of 1q and 7q, losses of 6q, 11q, 13q, and 17p. In addition, our findings indicate a linear clonal evolution to be the predominant manner of cytogenetic evolution. Our data may provide a biological framework for the dismal outcome of progressive and relapsing Burkitt lymphoma.},

   abstract = {We will need collective action to avoid catastrophic climate change, and this will require valuing the long term as well as the short term. Shortsightedness and uncertainty have hindered progress in resolving this collective action problem and have been recognized as important barriers to cooperation among humans. Here, we propose a coupled social–ecological dilemma to investigate the interdependence of three well-identified components of this cooperation problem: 1) timescales of collapse and recovery in relation to time preferences regarding future outcomes, 2) the magnitude of the impact of collapse, and 3) the number of actors in the collective. We find that, under a sufficiently severe and time-distant collapse, how much the actors care for the future can transform the game from a tragedy of the commons into one of coordination, and even into a comedy of the commons in which cooperation dominates. Conversely, we also find conditions under which even strong concern for the future still does not transform the problem from tragedy to comedy. For a large number of participating actors, we find that the critical collapse impact, at which these game regime changes happen, converges to a fixed value of collapse impact per actor that is independent of the enhancement factor of the public good, which is usually regarded as the driver of the dilemma. Our results not only call for experimental testing but also help explain why polarization in beliefs about human-caused climate change can threaten global cooperation agreements.

   abstract = {We investigate the dynamics of cancer initiation in a mathematical
model with one driver mutation and several passenger mutations. Our
analysis is based on a multi-type branching process: we model individual
cells which can either divide or undergo apoptosis. In the case of
a cell division, the two daughter cells can mutate, which potentially
confers a change in fitness to the cell. In contrast to previous
models, the change in fitness induced by the driver mutation depends
on the genetic context of the cell, in our case on the number of
passenger mutations. The passenger mutations themselves have no or
only a very small impact on the cell׳s fitness. While our model
is not designed as a specific model for a particular cancer, the
underlying idea is motivated by clinical and experimental observations
in Burkitt Lymphoma. In this tumor, the hallmark mutation leads to
deregulation of the MYC oncogene which increases the rate of apoptosis,
but also the proliferation rate of cells. This increase in the rate
of apoptosis hence needs to be overcome by mutations affecting apoptotic
pathways, naturally leading to an epistatic fitness landscape. This
model shows a very interesting dynamical behavior which is distinct
from the dynamics of cancer initiation in the absence of epistasis.
Since the driver mutation is deleterious to a cell with only a few
passenger mutations, there is a period of stasis in the number of
cells until a clone of cells with enough passenger mutations emerges.
Only when the driver mutation occurs in one of those cells, the cell
population starts to grow rapidly.},

are mutation and selection. Assuming small mutation rates, evolution
can be predicted based solely on the fitness differences between
phenotypes. Predicting an evolutionary process under varying mutation
rates as well as varying fitness is still an open question. Experimental
procedures, however, do include these complexities along with fluctuating
population sizes and stochastic events such as extinctions. We investigate
the mutational path probabilities of systems having epistatic effects
on both fitness and mutation rates using a theoretical and computational
framework. In contrast to previous models, we do not limit ourselves
to the typical strong selection, weak mutation (SSWM)-regime or to
fixed population sizes. Rather we allow epistatic interactions to
also affect mutation rates. This can lead to qualitatively non-trivial
dynamics. Pathways, that are negligible in the SSWM-regime, can overcome
fitness valleys and become accessible. This finding has the potential
to extend the traditional predictions based on the SSWM foundation
and bring us closer to what is observed in experimental systems.},

   abstract = {The ubiquity of global change and its impacts on biodiversity poses
a clear and urgent challenge for evolutionary biologists. In many
cases, environmental change is so widespread and rapid that individuals
can neither accommodate to them physiologically nor migrate to a
more favourable site. Extinction will ensue unless the population
adapts fast enough to counter the rate of decline. According to theory,
whether populations can be rescued by evolution depends upon several
crucial variables: population size, the supply of genetic variation,
and the degree of maladaptation to the new environment. Using techniques
in experimental evolution we tested the conditions for evolutionary
rescue ({ER}). Hundreds of yeast populations were exposed to normally
lethal concentrations of salt in conditions, where the frequency
of rescue mutations was estimated and population size was manipulated.
In a striking match with theory, we show that {ER} is possible, and
that the recovery of the population may occur within 25 generations.
We observed a clear threshold in population size for {ER} whereby
the ancestral population size must be sufficiently large to counter
stochastic extinction and contain resistant individuals. These results
demonstrate that rapid evolution is an important component of the
response of small populations to environmental change.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: All living organisms are made of individual and identifiable
cells, whose number, together with their size and type, ultimately
defines the structure and functions of an organism. While the total
cell number of lower organisms is often known, it has not yet been
defined in higher organisms. In particular, the reported total cell
number of a human being ranges between 10(12) and 10(16) and it is
widely mentioned without a proper reference. AIM: To study and discuss
the theoretical issue of the total number of cells that compose the
standard human adult organism. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A systematic
calculation of the total cell number of the whole human body and
of the single organs was carried out using bibliographical and/or
mathematical approaches. RESULTS: A current estimation of human total
cell number calculated for a variety of organs and cell types is
presented. These partial data correspond to a total number of 3.72 × 10(13).
CONCLUSIONS: Knowing the total cell number of the human body as well
as of individual organs is important from a cultural, biological,
medical and comparative modelling point of view. The presented cell
count could be a starting point for a common effort to complete the
total calculation.},

germline TP53 mutations in the majority of families. We have investigated
cancer incidence in 34 Li-Fraumeni families, according to their constitutional
TP53 mutation status. Families with germline missense mutations in
the core DNA binding domain showed a more highly penetrant cancer
phenotype than families with other TP53 mutations or no mutation.
Cancer phenotype in families carrying such mutations was characterized
by a higher cancer incidence and earlier ages at diagnosis, especially
of breast cancer and brain tumours, compared with families carrying
protein truncating or other inactivating mutations (P=0.03 for all
cancers, P=0.006 for breast cancers, P=0.05 for brain tumours). Proband
cancers showed significantly younger ages at diagnosis in those with
missense mutations in the DNA binding domain than in those with protein
inactivating mutations (P=0.031). In individuals with the former
type of mutation, there was a significantly lower proportion of tumours
which showed loss of the wild-type TP53 allele (P=0.004). These results
are consistent with observations in experimental systems which demonstrate
that certain mutations exhibit gain of function and/or dominant-negative
properties. Our results support an enhanced oncogenic potential for
such mutations in human populations.},

World Health Organisation (WHO) classification, we wondered whether
BL should not be considered as a different disease in children compared
with adults. Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR) data were obtained
from 1994 to 1998 (n=203). Detailed clinical data from two treatment
protocols were compared: one for adults up to the age of 65 years
(n=27) and one for children (n=80). All slides of the two clinical
studies were centrally reviewed which included immunophenotyping
and when necessary breakpoint analysis of MYC/8q24. Only cases with
an unambiguous diagnosis of BL (classical and atypical BL) were accepted.
The age distribution of BL-patients showed a bimodal distribution
with a peak at the paediatric age and a steady increase after approximately
60 years of age. Most of the patients were males (89% for children
and 78% for adults) and only male patients showed this bimodality.
Children more often had extranodal disease (81% vs. 59%), whereas
adults more often had nodal disease (89% vs. 53%). Based on epidemiology
and clinical presentation, the concept that BL is one disease should
be re-challenged.},

   abstract = {Burkitt lymphoma (BL) has a characteristic clinical presentation,
morphology, immunophenotype and primary chromosomal aberration, that
is, the translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32) or its variants. However,
diagnostic dilemmas may arise in daily practice due to overlap of
BL with subsets of other aggressive, mature B-cell lymphomas such
as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Recently, two gene expression
studies have described a distinct molecular profile for BL, but also
showed the persistence of some cases intermediate between BL and
DLBCL. An alternative approach to define BL is to consider (cyto)genetic
data, in particular chromosomal abnormalities other than the t(8;14)
or its variants. In this review the 'Mitelman Database of Chromosome
Aberrations in Cancer,' harboring the majority of all published neoplasia-related
karyotypes, was explored to define a cytogenetic profile of 'true'
BL. This core subset of BL showed a very low complexity of chromosomal
abnormalities with 40% of the cases having the IG-MYC fusion as the
sole abnormality. In the remaining cases, additional recurrent but
partially exclusive abnormalities included gains at chromosomes 1q,
7 and 12, and losses of 6q, 13q32-34 and 17p. Within the core subset,
no differences were found between pediatric and adult patients. In
addition, the genetic profile of the core subset was significantly
different from BL with an 8q24 breakpoint not affecting one of the
three immunoglobulin loci, BL with a translocation involving 18q21/BCL2,
3q27/BCL6 or 11q13/BCL1, additionally to a breakpoint at 8q24/MYC,
and from other morphological types of lymphomas with an 8q24/MYC
breakpoint. These groups showed a higher cytogenetic complexity than
the core subset of BL. BL without a detectable 8q24/MYC breakpoint
might be heterogeneous and deserves further studies. We suggest that,
concordant with the WHO classification to be published in 2008, the
diagnosis of BL should be restricted to cases with expression of
CD10 and BCL6, absence or very weak expression of BCL2 protein, a
homogeneously very high proliferation index and a proven IG-MYC translocation
without evidence of a chromosomal translocation typical for other
lymphoma entities. In addition, a high number of nonspecific cytogenetic
abnormalities should suggest need for a critical review of the diagnosis
of BL.},

decay into sustained coherent oscillations with a large amplitude.
We show that a similar effect occurs when the stable attractors are
limit cycles. We compute the correlation functions and spectral properties
of the fluctuations in suitably comoving Frenet frames for several
model systems including driven and coupled Brusselators, and the
Willamowski-R{\"o}ssler system. Analytical results are confirmed
convincingly in numerical simulations. The effect is quite general,
and occurs whenever the Floquet multipliers governing the stability
of the limit cycle are complex, with the amplitude of the oscillations
increasing as the instability boundary is approached.},

to model intergroup conflicts involving bilateral threats (e.g.,
military conflicts, industrial disputes). The group that wins the
game is the one that competes while the other group yields, and the
benefits associated with winning (e.g., territory, higher wages)
are public goods for the members of that group. However, a failure
to yield on the part of both groups leads to an outcome (e.g., war,
strike) that is disastrous to all the players. The authors report
an experiment in which an intergroup chicken game with two players
on each team was compared to a two-person chicken game and a (single-group)
four-person chicken game. The games were played repeatedly, and each
round was preceded by a signaling period. Results showed that subjects
were more competitive (and, consequently, less efficient) in the
intergroup chicken game than in either the two-person or the four-person
chicken game.},

for analyzing the prototypical problems of cooperation and competition
that arise within and between groups, and to review an extensive
research program that has used this framework to study individual
and group behavior in the laboratory. Depending on the game's payoff
structure, contradictions or conflicts are created among the rational
choices at the individual, group, and collective levels---a generalization
of the contradiction between individual and collective rationality
occurring in the traditional mixed-motive games. These contradictions
are studied so as to identify the theoretical and behavioral conditions
that determine which level of rationality prevails.},

of the evolution of human social behavior. Yet whether ancestral
humans were largely ``peaceful'' or ``warlike'' remains controversial.
I ask a more precise question: If more cooperative groups were more
likely to prevail in conflicts with other groups, was the level of
intergroup violence sufficient to influence the evolution of human
social behavior? Using a model of the evolutionary impact of between-group
competition and a new data set that combines archaeological evidence
on causes of death during the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene
with ethnographic and historical reports on hunter-gatherer populations,
I find that the estimated level of mortality in intergroup conflicts
would have had substantial effects, allowing the proliferation of
group-beneficial behaviors that were quite costly to the individual
altruist.},

   abstract = { We review current ideas about coevolution of plants and parasites,
particularly processes that generate genetic diversity. Frequencies
of host resistance and parasite virulence alleles that interact in
gene-for-gene (GFG) relationships coevolve in the familiar boom-and-bust
cycle, in which resistance is selected when virulence is rare, and
virulence is selected when resistance is common. The cycle can result
in stable polymorphism when diverse ecological and epidemiological
factors cause negative direct frequency-dependent selection (ndFDS)
on host resistance, parasite virulence, or both, such that the benefit
of a trait to fitness declines as its frequency increases. Polymorphism
can also be stabilized by overdominance, when heterozygous hosts
have greater resistance than homozygotes to diverse pathogens. Genetic
diversity can also persist in the form of statistical polymorphism,
sustained by random processes acting on gene frequencies and population
size. Stable polymorphism allows alleles to be long-lived and genetic
variation to be detectable in natural populations. In agriculture,
many of the factors promoting stability in host-parasite interactions
have been lost, leading to arms races of host defenses and parasite
effectors. },

BLUE-1 carries the pathognomonic t(8;14)(q24;q32) effecting MYC/IgHJ
fusion and a novel t(6;20)(q15;q11.2) originally present in the patient,
analysis of which may facilitate identification of gene target(s)

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32), involving
the c-myc gene (8q24) and the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus
(14q32), represents about 75% of all chromosomal translocations in
Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). Due to the large variability of the breakpoint
region, only the recently improved long-distance LD-polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) allows the specific c-myc/IgH fusion to be identified
at the genomic level. The sensitivity of the LD-PCR is only 10(-2)
to 10(-3) due to the relatively large size of the amplification products
(1 to 10 kbp). We, therefore, established a more sensitive nested
PCR with a specific primer combination for each patient based on
sequence analysis of the variant breakpoint regions. DESIGN AND METHODS:
Using the combined PCR methods, we analyzed bone marrow and peripheral
blood without visible blasts at diagnosis from 18 patients with t(8;14)-positive
BL. RESULTS: In tests employing dilutions of genomic DNA from the
BL cell line CA-46 in the T-cell lymphoma cell line KARPAS-299, which
lacks the t(8;14), the sensitivity increased 100-fold, to 10(-5).
However, the investigation of 18 c-myc/IgH-positive BL patients with
each breakpoint-specific nested PCR showed an inter-patient variability
of sensitivity between 10(-3) and 10(-5). Using this assay, the rearrangement
was detected in 4/16 bone marrow samples and in 6/15 peripheral blood
samples without visible blasts at diagnosis. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS:
Using the combined PCR methods the detection of c-myc/IgH reaches
a level of sensitivity required for the evaluation of minimal residual
disease (MRD) in BL patients. Furthermore, the results highlight
the importance of verifying the patient-specific sensitivity level
for individual MRD monitoring.},

with an intra-group cooperation dilemma and inter-group competition.
In our design subjects receive information about their relative individual
and group performance after each round with non-incentivized and
then incentivized group competition. We found that, on average, individuals
with low relative performance reduce their contributions to the public
good, but groups with low performance increase theirs. With incentivized
competition, where the relative ranking of the group increases individual
payoffs, the reaction to relative performance is larger with individuals
contributing more to the group; further, we observe that the variance
of strategies decreases as individual and group rankings increase.
These results offer new insights on how social comparison shapes
similar reactions in games with different incentives for group performance
and how competition and cooperation can influence each other.},

parochialism---hostility toward individuals not of one's own ethnic,
racial, or other group---are common human behaviors. The intersection
of the two---which we term ``parochial altruism''---is puzzling from
an evolutionary perspective because altruistic or parochial behavior
reduces one's payoffs by comparison to what one would gain by eschewing
these behaviors. But parochial altruism could have evolved if parochialism
promoted intergroup hostilities and the combination of altruism and
parochialism contributed to success in these conflicts. Our game-theoretic
analysis and agent-based simulations show that under conditions likely
to have been experienced by late Pleistocene and early Holocene humans,
neither parochialism nor altruism would have been viable singly,
but by promoting group conflict, they could have evolved jointly.},

   abstract = {The Red Queen Hypothesis (RQH) explains how pathogens may maintain
sexual reproduction in hosts. It assumes that parasites become specialized
on common host genotypes, reducing their fitness. Such frequency-dependent
selection favors sexual reproduction in host populations. Necessary
conditions are that resistance and virulence are genotype specific
so that host genotype frequencies respond to changes in pathogen
genotype frequencies, and vice versa. Empirical evidence on the genetic
basis of disease, variation in resistance and virulence, and patterns
of infection in sexual and asexual plants support certain features
of the hypothesis. However, gene-for-gene interactions are generally
not consistent with the RQH because they do not result in cycling
of gene frequencies, unlike a matching allele mechanism. A conclusion
of whether the RQH can explain the maintenance of sexual reproduction
cannot be reached at present. Nevertheless, the RQH theory has shed
light on many aspects of plant/pathogen interactions important for
reducing pathogen damage in agricultural systems. },

   abstract = {A general model which accommodates different fitness values of an
individual in association with each other type of individual is studied.
The model in conjunction with population composition, in which individuals
are assumed to be dispersed at random, determines the relative fitness
values of individuals. Expressions for the change in gene frequency
and for the mean are derived for one locus with two alleles in a
random mating population. Equilibrium and max/min mean compositions
generally require solving third-degree equations, but explicit expressions
are found for models with general levels of dominance and some of
their variants. Protected polymorphisms, genetic loads, inbreeding
depressions, and the cost of a gene substitution are also considered.
Many additional features of the statics and dynamics of populations
are introduced with the effects of population composition on fitnesses.
A single globally stable equilibrium can exist without any dominance.
There may be multiple equilibria, up to three, with various stability
characteristics, some of which are protected polymorphisms. There
need not be any correspondence between compositions for max/min means
and those for equilibria. Inbreeding depressions may be curvilinear,
and even stable equilibrium populations may show negative inbreeding
depressions. Very different models may give the same genetic load.
The number of genetic deaths required for a gene substitution may
be as few as twice the population size. One appeal of the model is
that it encompasses several classes of models, including those with
constant fitness values, and thus provides a basis for determining
the appropriate model. After considering alternative experiments
and measures of discrimination, we conclude that only survival values
of the genotypes for several population compositions would be sufficient
to discriminate between certain models.},

   abstract = {Abstract Non-Darwinian theories about the emergence and evolution
of complexity date back at least to Lamarck, and include those of
Herbert Spencer and the ``emergent evolution'' theorists of the later
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In recent decades, this
approach has mostly been espoused by various practitioners in biophysics
and complexity theory. However, there is a Darwinian alternative
-- in essence, an economic theory of complexity -- proposing that
synergistic effects of various kinds have played an important causal
role in the evolution of complexity, especially in the ``major transitions''.
This theory is called the ``synergism hypothesis''. We posit that
otherwise unattainable functional advantages arising from various
cooperative phenomena have been favored over time in a dynamic that
the late John Maynard Smith characterized and modeled as ``synergistic
selection''. The term highlights the fact that synergistic ``wholes''
may become interdependent ``units'' of selection. We provide some
historical perspective on this issue, as well as a brief explication
of the underlying theory and the concept of synergistic selection,
and we describe two relevant models.},

   abstract = {Cooperativeness is a defining feature of human nature. Theoreticians
have suggested several mechanisms to explain this ubiquitous phenomenon,
including reciprocity, reputation, and punishment, but the problem
is still unsolved. Here we show, through experiments conducted with
groups of people playing an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma on a dynamic
network, that it is reputation what really fosters cooperation. While
this mechanism has already been observed in unstructured populations,
we find that it acts equally when interactions are given by a network
that players can reconfigure dynamically. Furthermore, our observations
reveal that memory also drives the network formation process, and
cooperators assort more, with longer link lifetimes, the longer the
past actions record. Our analysis demonstrates, for the first time,
that reputation can be very well quantified as a weighted mean of
the fractions of past cooperative acts and the last action performed.
This finding has potential applications in collaborative systems
and e-commerce.},

   abstract = {For more than a decade, numerous studies have suggested that the c-Myc
oncogenic protein is likely to broadly influence the composition
of the transcriptome. However, the evidence required to support this
notion was made available only recently, much to the anticipation
of an eagerly awaiting field. In the past 5 years, many high-throughput
screens based on microarray gene expression profiling, serial analysis
of gene expression (SAGE), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed
by genomic array analysis, and Myc-methylase chimeric proteins have
generated a wealth of information regarding Myc responsive and target
genes. From these studies, the c-Myc target gene network is estimated
to comprise about 15% of all genes from flies to humans. Both genomic
and functional analyses of c-Myc targets suggest that while c-Myc
behaves as a global regulator of transcription, groups of genes involved
in cell cycle regulation, metabolism, ribosome biogenesis, protein
synthesis, and mitochondrial function are over-represented in the
c-Myc target gene network. c-Myc also consistently represses genes
involved in cell growth arrest and cell adhesion. The overexpression
of c-Myc predisposes cells to apoptosis under nutrient or growth
factor deprivation conditions, although the critical sets of genes
involved remain elusive. Despite tremendous advances, the downstream
target genes that distinguish between physiologic and tumorigenic
functions of c-Myc remain to be delineated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The distinction between Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse
large-B-cell lymphoma is crucial because these two types of lymphoma
require different treatments. We examined whether gene-expression
profiling could reliably distinguish Burkitt's lymphoma from diffuse
large-B-cell lymphoma. METHODS: Tumor-biopsy specimens from 303 patients
with aggressive lymphomas were profiled for gene expression and were
also classified according to morphology, immunohistochemistry, and
detection of the t(8;14) c-myc translocation. RESULTS: A classifier
based on gene expression correctly identified all 25 pathologically
verified cases of classic Burkitt's lymphoma. Burkitt's lymphoma
was readily distinguished from diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma by the
high level of expression of c-myc target genes, the expression of
a subgroup of germinal-center B-cell genes, and the low level of
expression of major-histocompatibility-complex class I genes and
nuclear factor-kappaB target genes. Eight specimens with a pathological
diagnosis of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma had the typical gene-expression
profile of Burkitt's lymphoma, suggesting they represent cases of
Burkitt's lymphoma that are difficult to diagnose by current methods.
Among 28 of the patients with a molecular diagnosis of Burkitt's
lymphoma, the overall survival was superior among those who had received
intensive chemotherapy regimens instead of lower-dose regimens. CONCLUSIONS:
Gene-expression profiling is an accurate, quantitative method for
distinguishing Burkitt's lymphoma from diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma.},

   abstract = {Understanding the evolution of social behaviours such as altruism
and spite is a long-standing problem that has generated thousands
of articles and heated debates. Previous theoretical studies showed
that whether altruism and spite evolve may be contingent on seemingly
artificial model features, such as which rule is chosen to update
the population (for example, birth--death or death--birth), and whether
the benefits and costs of sociality affect fecundity or survival.
Here we unify these features in a single comprehensive framework.
We derive a general condition for social behaviour to be favoured
over non-social behaviour, which is applicable in a large class of
models for structured populations of fixed size. We recover previous
results as special cases, and we are able to evaluate the relative
effects of benefits and costs of social interactions on fecundity
and survival. Our results highlight the crucial importance of identifying
the relative scale at which competition occurs.},

   abstract = {Most human tumors result from the accumulation of multiple genetic
and epigenetic alterations in a single cell. Mutations that confer
a fitness advantage to the cell are known as driver mutations and
are causally related to tumorigenesis. Other mutations, however,
do not change the phenotype of the cell or even decrease cellular
fitness. While much experimental effort is being devoted to the identification
of the functional effects of individual mutations, mathematical modeling
of tumor progression generally considers constant fitness increments
as mutations are accumulated. In this paper we study a mathematical
model of tumor progression with random fitness increments. We analyze
a multi-type branching process in which cells accumulate mutations
whose fitness effects are chosen from a distribution. We determine
the effect of the fitness distribution on the growth kinetics of
the tumor. This work contributes to a quantitative understanding
of the accumulation of mutations leading to cancer.},

to transform cells on their own due to the activation of pathways
that restrain proliferation. Previous studies have shown that oncogenic
H-Ras can induce proliferative arrest or senescence, depending on
the cellular context. Here, we show that deregulated H-Ras activity
can also lead to caspase-independent cell death with features of
autophagy. Ras-induced autophagy was associated with upregulation
of the BH3-only protein Noxa as well as the autophagy regulator Beclin-1.
Silencing of Noxa or Beclin-1 expression reduced Ras-induced autophagy
and increased clonogenic survival. Ras-induced cell death was also
inhibited by coexpression of Bcl-2 family members that inhibit Beclin-1
function. Ras-induced autophagy was associated with Noxa-mediated
displacement of the Bcl-2 family member, Mcl-1, from Beclin-1. Thus,
Ras-induced expression of Noxa and Beclin-1 promotes autophagic cell
death, which represents a mechanism to limit the oncogenic potential
of deregulated Ras signals.},

   abstract = {We analyse metapopulation dynamics in terms of an individual-based,
stochastic model of a finite metapopulation. We suggest a new approach,
using the number of patches in the population as a large parameter.
This approach does not require that the number of individuals per
patch is large, neither is it necessary to assume a time-scale separation
between local population dynamics and migration. Our approach makes
it possible to accurately describe the dynamics of metapopulations
consisting of many small patches. We focus on metapopulations on
the brink of extinction. We estimate the time to extinction and describe
the most likely path to extinction. We find that the logarithm of
the time to extinction is proportional to the product of two vectors,
a vector characterising the distribution of patch population sizes
in the quasi-steady state, and a vector-related to Fisher's reproduction
vector-that quantifies the sensitivity of the quasi-steady state
distribution to demographic fluctuations. We compare our analytical
results to stochastic simulations of the model, and discuss the range
of validity of the analytical expressions. By identifying fast and
slow degrees of freedom in the metapopulation dynamics, we show that
the dynamics of large metapopulations close to extinction is approximately
described by a deterministic equation originally proposed by Levins
(1969). We were able to compute the rates in Levins' equation in
terms of the parameters of our stochastic, individual-based model.
It turns out, however, that the interpretation of the dynamical variable
depends strongly on the intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity
of the patches. Only when the local growth rate and the carrying
capacity are large does the slow variable correspond to the number
of patches, as envisaged by Levins. Last but not least, we discuss
how our findings relate to other, widely used metapopulation models.},

   abstract = {Detectable polymorphism of host resistance and parasite host range
is a poor guide to the specificity of a host--parasite interaction.
I analyse a simple haploid model to support this claim. The model
assumes that the true specificity is `matching-allele', in which
each of n host alleles causes resistance to only one of n different
parasite alleles. The detectable polymorphism in samples from a matching-allele
system would lead one to infer the gene-for-gene specificity commonly
observed in plant-pathogen interactions. Gene-for-gene and matching-allele
specificity require very different fitness assumptions to explain
observed patterns of polymorphism. Yet models for each type of specificity
can easily be constructed that fit the available data. In addition,
the currently favoured `elicitor-receptor' model for the biochemistry
of plant-pathogen recognition agrees equally well with gene-for-gene
or matching-allele specificity. I do not claim that the simple matching-allele
specificity is the correct model for plant--pathogen genetics. My
point is that one cannot reconstruct both specificity and population
history from patterns of resistance among host--parasite pairs in
a sample. I draw two conclusions: first, inferred specificity and
polymorphism are only useful when compared with a family of theoretical
models; and secondly, biochemical models of specificity must be tested
by their population genetic consequences.},

in AML, but it is not known whether alterations outside these regions
contribute to leukemogenesis. We used a high-throughput platform
to interrogate the entire FLT3 coding sequence in AML patients without
known FLT3 mutations and experimentally tested the consequences of
each candidate leukemogenic allele. This approach identified gain-of-function
mutations that activated downstream signaling and conferred sensitivity
to FLT3 inhibition and alleles that were not associated with kinase
activation, including mutations in the catalytic domain. These findings
support the concept that acquired mutations in cancer may not contribute
to malignant transformation and underscore the importance of functional
studies to distinguish "driver" mutations underlying tumorigenesis
from biologically neutral "passenger" alterations.},

to be significantly more adapted to their local host populations
than to hosts from distant populations. We developed a metapopulation
model, taking explicit account of both population densities and gene
frequencies, to determine the influence of ecological and genetical
parameters on the local adaptation of the parasites and on the spatial
distribution of resistance and virulence genes. Our results point
to the predominant effect of ecological parameters such as parasite
growth rate and host and parasite migration rates on coevolutionary
outcomes. In particular, the parasites are more likely to be adapted
to their local host population than to allopatric hosts when the
parasite migration rate is larger than the host migration rate. The
opposite should be observed whenever hosts migrate more than parasites.},

   abstract = {Understanding host range evolution in plant viruses is central for
the control of viral diseases: changes in host range resulting in
host switches or host range expansions are at the root of virus emergence
either in new host species or in host genotypes previously resistant
to the virus. Theory predicts that different selection pressures
in different hosts will result in fitness trade-offs across hosts,
leading to specialization. This paper reviews the evidence in support
of this prediction. A large fraction of plant viruses are multihost
parasites: evidence for across-species trade-offs has been reported
both from the analysis of field virus populations and, more often,
from passage experiments resulting in host adaptation. More abundant
evidence for across-host trade-offs derives from the analysis of
the performance of resistance-breaking virus genotypes in resistant
and susceptible host genotypes. Data indicate that overcoming dominant
resistance is coupled to severe fitness costs, while overcoming recessive
resistance may be associated with fitness costs according to the
specific virus genotype. There is ample evidence that antagonistic
pleiotropy is a major cause of the reported across-host trade-offs.},

   abstract = {In large mammalian herbivores, the increase of group size with habitat
openness was first assumed to be an adaptive response, encoded in
the individual. However, it could, alternatively, be an emergent
property: if groups were nonpermanent units, often fusing and splitting
up, then any increase of the distance at which animals perceive one
another could increase the rate of group fusion and thus mean group
size. Dynamical models and empirical data support this second hypothesis.
This is not to say that adaptive modifications of mean herd size
cannot occur. However, this changes the way in which we can envisage
the history of gregariousness in large herbivores during
the Tertiary.},

   abstract = {A series of experiments is described in which fragments derived from
two mammary tumors
of distinct types were transferred at different developmental stages
to the anterior chamber of the eye of normal rabbits. It was found
that the ability to survive and to grow progressively after transplantation
was not immediately related to anaplastic cellular changes. On the
other hand, there existed a definite correlation between the success
of transplantation and the morphological relationship of tumor cells
and the normal cells of the host. Transplantation to normal animals
could not be effected during stages of local tissue invasion but
was successfully performed as soon as the tumor cells manifested
the ability to invade foreign tissues or to metastasize in the spontaneous
host. It was concluded, therefore, that neither anaplasia nor local
tissue invasion represented autonomy but, rather, stages in its development
and that the final attainment of this condition was only evidenced
by metastasis or by invasion in foreign tissues. The tumors were
successfully transplanted to normal animals during this series of
experiments and have been carried by serial transfer to the present
time. The most outstanding feature in the transplantation of the
papillary type tumor was the marked difference in susceptibility
exhibited by the two sexes. The acinar type tumor was distinguished
by high transplantability, an extremely rapid growth rate and early
regression.},

   abstract = {Economists and psychologists have been testing Nash equilibrium predictions
of game theory models of human behavior. In many instances, humans
do not conform to the predictions. These results are of great interest
to biologists because they also raise questions about well-known
ESS models of cooperation. Cooperation in certain one-shot, anonymous
interactions, and a willingness to punish others at a net cost to
oneself are some of the most intriguing deviations from standard
theory. One proposed explanation for these results that is receiving
increasing attention invokes the cultural group selection of `other
regarding' social norms. We critically review this explanation. We
conclude that experimental results reveal limits in two implicit
models of cognitive structure commonly employed by economists and
evolutionary biologists.},

Simultaneous estimates from marrow obtained by rib excision produced
a mean value of 11.1 x 10(9) nucleated cells/kg. Previous work by
this and other methods is reviewed. While some results agree well
with those of the present work, one is higher by 50% and another
by 300%. Corrections are suggested which reduce these figures and
bring all published results within a small range. Reasonably accurate
determinations of total marrow cellularity in disease will not be
possible until more is known of marrow Fe(59) uptake in abnormal
states.},

enemies is a mutualistic relationship with ants or the occurrence
of a specialised soldier caste typcial for eusocial aphids, or even
both. Despite a group-living life style of those aphid species lacking
these defense lines, communal defense against natural predators has
not yet been observed there. Individuals of <italic>Aphis nerii</italic>
(Oleander aphid) and <italic>Uroleucon hypochoeridis</italic>, an
aphid species feeding on <italic>Hypochoeris radicata</italic> (hairy
cat's ear), show a behavioral response to visual stimulation in the
form of spinning or twitching, which is often accompanied by coordinated
kicks executed with hind legs. Interestingly, this behaviour is highly
synchronized among members of a colony and repetitive visual stimulation
caused strong habituation. Observations of natural aphid colonies
revealed that a collective twitching and kicking response (CTKR)
was frequently evoked during oviposition attempts of the parasitoid
wasp <italic>Aphidius colemani</italic> and during attacks of aphidophagous
larvae. CTKR effectively interrupted oviposition attempts of this
parasitoid wasp and even repelled this parasitoid from colonies after
evoking consecutive CTKRs. In contrast, solitary feeding <italic>A.
nerii</italic> individuals were not able to successfully repel this
parasitoid wasp. In addition, CTKR was also evoked through gentle
substrate vibrations. Laser vibrometry of the substrate revealed
twitching-associated vibrations that form a train of sharp acceleration
peaks in the course of a CTKR. This suggests that visual signals
in combination with twitching-related substrate vibrations may play
an important role in synchronising defense among members of a colony.
In both aphid species collective defense in encounters with different
natural enemies was executed in a stereotypical way and was similar
to CTKR evoked through visual stimulation. This cooperative defense
behavior provides an example of a surprising sociality that can be
found in some aphid species that are not expected to be social at
all.</p>},

on collective rent seeking and private provision of a public good.
Each individual agent within each group chooses in continuous or
discrete time a continuous or discrete effort level. The combined
effort within each group provides within-group public goods which
are used as an input in the between-group n-group competition for
an external prize. Intergroup mobility and intergroup warfare are
allowed for. Each group and each individual agent within each group
get a fraction of the prize based on a linear combination of equity
and relative effort. A model/algorithm is developed generating analytical
results and simulations illustrating how the interaction within and
between groups proceeds through time.},

of sufficiently low Darwinian fitness, (s)he will have reduced chances
of keeping cancerous lesions in check. While we clearly need to better
understand the emergence of precursor states and early malignancies
as well as their mitigation by the microenvironment and tissue architecture,
we argue that lifestyle changes and preventive therapies based in
an evolutionary framework, applied to identified high-risk populations
before incipient neoplasms become clinically detectable and chemoresistant
lineages emerge, are currently the most reliable way to control or
eliminate early tumours. Specifically, the relatively low levels
of (epi)genetic heterogeneity characteristic of many if not most
incipient lesions will mean a relatively limited set of possible
adaptive traits and associated costs compared to more advanced cancers,
and thus a more complete and predictable understanding of treatment
options and outcomes. We propose a conceptual model for preventive
treatments and discuss the many associated challenges.},

   abstract = {c-MYC has a pivotal function in growth control, differentiation and
apoptosis, and its abnormal expression is associated with many tumors.
Overexpression of c-MYC sensitizes cells to apoptosis by a variety
of stimuli. The decision of a cell to undergo apoptosis and how this
apoptotic response is regulated by c-MYC depends on the specific
cell type and the physiological status of the cell. Multiple cooperating
molecular pathways of cell survival and apoptosis determine whether
a cell lives or dies, and understanding how c-MYC interfaces with
these pathways to influence the survival of cells is important to
understand normal and abnormal development, tumor initiation and
progression, and response of tumors to different treatment regimens.
This article will provide an overview of the function of the tumor
suppressor gene product p53 in the c-MYC-mediated apoptotic response
and how c-MYC amplifies the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and triggers
and/or amplifies the death receptor pathways. Finally, a model for
how deregulated c-MYC prematurely triggers the normal apoptotic response
associated with terminal myeloid differentiation while also blocking
the differentiation program is presented.},

   abstract = {The global burden of cancer continues to increase largely because
of the aging and growth of the world population alongside an increasing
adoption of cancer-causing behaviors, particularly smoking, in economically
developing countries. Based on the GLOBOCAN 2008 estimates, about
12.7 million cancer cases and 7.6 million cancer deaths are estimated
to have occurred in 2008; of these, 56% of the cases and 64% of the
deaths occurred in the economically developing world. Breast cancer
is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of
cancer death among females, accounting for 23% of the total cancer
cases and 14% of the cancer deaths. Lung cancer is the leading cancer
site in males, comprising 17% of the total new cancer cases and 23%
of the total cancer deaths. Breast cancer is now also the leading
cause of cancer death among females in economically developing countries,
a shift from the previous decade during which the most common cause
of cancer death was cervical cancer. Further, the mortality burden
for lung cancer among females in developing countries is as high
as the burden for cervical cancer, with each accounting for 11% of
the total female cancer deaths. Although overall cancer incidence
rates in the developing world are half those seen in the developed
world in both sexes, the overall cancer mortality rates are generally
similar. Cancer survival tends to be poorer in developing countries,
most likely because of a combination of a late stage at diagnosis
and limited access to timely and standard treatment. A substantial
proportion of the worldwide burden of cancer could be prevented through
the application of existing cancer control knowledge and by implementing
programs for tobacco control, vaccination (for liver and cervical
cancers), and early detection and treatment, as well as public health
campaigns promoting physical activity and a healthier dietary intake.
Clinicians, public health professionals, and policy makers can play
an active role in accelerating the application of such interventions
globally.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is curable in 60% of
patients treated with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). MYC translocations, with or
without BCL2 translocations, have been associated with inferior survival
in DLBCL. We investigated whether expression of MYC protein, with
or without BCL2 protein expression, could risk-stratify patients
at diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We determined the correlation
between presence of MYC and BCL2 proteins by immunohistochemistry
(IHC) with survival in two independent cohorts of patients with DLBCL
treated with R-CHOP. We further determined if MYC protein expression
correlated with high MYC mRNA and/or presence of MYC translocation.
RESULTS: In the training cohort (n = 167), MYC and BCL2 proteins
were detected in 29% and 44% of patients, respectively. Concurrent
expression (MYC positive/BCL2 positive) was present in 21% of patients.
MYC protein correlated with presence of high MYC mRNA and MYC translocation
(both P < .001), but the latter was less frequent (both 11%). MYC
protein expression was only associated with inferior overall and
progression-free survival when BCL2 protein was coexpressed (P <
.001). Importantly, the poor prognostic effect of MYC positive/BCL2
positive was validated in an independent cohort of 140 patients with
DLBCL and remained significant (P < .05) after adjusting for presence
of high-risk features in a multivariable model that included elevated
international prognostic index score, activated B-cell molecular
subtype, and presence of concurrent MYC and BCL2 translocations.
CONCLUSION: Assessment of MYC and BCL2 expression by IHC represents
a robust, rapid, and inexpensive approach to risk-stratify patients
with DLBCL at diagnosis.},

   abstract = {The spatial distribution of organisms often differs across scales.
For instance, colonial bird populations could be described, from
large to small scale, as scattered clumps of otherwise regularly
distributed breeding pairs. We analysed the distribution of nests
of a large colonial population of white storks (Ciconia ciconia)
and found a fractal pattern in each of the 4 study years. Moreover,
we found that the often-observed, long-tailed frequency distribution
of colony sizes was well described by a power law, regardless of
the cut-off used to define colonies (from 16 to 1024 m). Thus,
although storks were locally highly clumped even with tens of nests
in a single tree, the population was not structured in colonies (a
simple clustered distribution) as previously thought. Rather, they
were distributed in a continuous hierarchical set of clusters within
clusters across scales, clusters lacking the commonly assumed characteristic
mean size. These quantitative solutions to previously perceived scaling
problems will potentially improve our understanding of the ecology
and evolution of bird coloniality and animal spacing patterns and
group living in general.},

and SOX2, cooperate to drive a stem-like phenotype in lung squamous
cell carcinoma (LSCC). Protein kinase Cι (PKCι) phosphorylates
SOX2, a master transcriptional regulator of stemness, and recruits
it to the promoter of Hedgehog (Hh) acyltransferase (HHAT) that catalyzes
the rate-limiting step in Hh ligand production. PKCι-mediated SOX2
phosphorylation is required for HHAT promoter occupancy, HHAT expression,
and maintenance of a stem-like phenotype. Primary LSCC tumors coordinately
overexpress PKCι, SOX2, and HHAT and require PKCι-SOX2-HHAT signaling
to maintain a stem-like phenotype. Thus, PKCι and SOX2 are genetically,
biochemically, and functionally linked in LSCC, and together they
drive tumorigenesis by establishing a cell-autonomous Hh signaling
axis.},

   abstract = {Epistatic interactions between mutations play a prominent role in
evolutionary theories. Many studies have found that epistasis is
widespread, but they have rarely considered beneficial mutations.
We analyzed the effects of epistasis on fitness for the first five
mutations to fix in an experimental population of Escherichia coli.
Epistasis depended on the effects of the combined mutations--the
larger the expected benefit, the more negative the epistatic effect.
Epistasis thus tended to produce diminishing returns with genotype
fitness, although interactions involving one particular mutation
had the opposite effect. These data support models in which negative
epistasis contributes to declining rates of adaptation over time.
Sign epistasis was rare in this genome-wide study, in contrast to
its prevalence in an earlier study of mutations in a single gene.},

between children and adolescents on the one hand and adult patients
on the other. Whereas adult maB-NHLs have been studied in detail,
data on molecular profiling of pediatric maB-NHLs are hitherto lacking.
We analyzed 65 cases of maB-NHL from patients up to 18 years of age
by gene expression profiling, matrix comparative genomic hybridization
(CGH), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and immunohistochemistry.
The majority of the analyzed pediatric patients were treated within
prospective trials (n = 49). We compared this group to a series of
182 previously published cases of adult maB-NHL. Gene expression
profiling reclassified 31% of morphologically defined diffuse large
B-cell lymphomas as molecular Burkitt lymphoma (mBL). The subgroups
obtained by molecular reclassification did not show any difference
in outcome in children treated with the NHL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster
(BFM) protocols. No differences were detectable between pediatric
and adult mBL with regard to gene expression or chromosomal imbalances.
This is the first report on molecular profiling of pediatric B-NHL
showing mBL to be much more prominent in children than suggested
by morphologic assessment. Based on molecular profiling mBL is a
molecularly homogeneous disease across children and adults.},

   abstract = {Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a clinically and genetically
heterogeneous disease. A small subset of DLBCLs has translocations
involving the MYC locus and an additional group has a molecular signature
resembling Burkitt lymphoma (mBL). Presently, identification of such
cases by morphology is unreliable and relies on cytogenetic or complex
molecular methods such as gene transcriptional profiling. Herein,
we describe an immunohistochemical (IHC) method for identifying DLBCLs
with increased MYC protein expression. We tested 77 cases of DLBCL
and identified 15 cases with high MYC protein expression (nuclear
staining in >50% of tumor cells). All MYC translocation positive
cases had increased MYC protein expression by this IHC assay. In
addition, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the DLBCL transcriptional
profiles revealed that tumors with increased MYC protein expression
(regardless of underlying MYC translocation status) had coordinate
upregulation of MYC target genes, providing molecular confirmation
of the IHC results. We then generated a molecular classifier derived
from the MYC IHC results in our cases and employed it to successfully
classify mBLs from two previously reported independent case series,
providing additional confirmation that the MYC IHC results identify
clinically important subsets of DLBCLs. Lastly, we found that DLBCLs
with high MYC protein expression had inferior overall survival when
treated with R-CHOP. In conclusion, the IHC method described herein
can be used to readily identify the biologically and clinically distinct
cases of MYC-driven DLBCL, which represent a clinically significant
subset of DLBCL cases due to their inferior overall survival.},

   abstract = {The evolution of complex traits requires the accumulation of multiple
mutations, which can be disadvantageous, neutral or advantageous
relative to the wild-type. We study two spatial (two-dimensional)
models of fitness valley crossing (the constant-population Moran
process and the non-constant-population contact process), varying
the number of loci involved and the degree of mixing. We find that
spatial interactions accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys in
the Moran process in the context of neutral and disadvantageous intermediate
mutants because of the formation of mutant islands that increase
the lifespan of mutant lineages. By contrast, in the contact process,
spatial structure can accelerate or delay the emergence of the complex
trait, and there can even be an optimal degree of mixing that maximizes
the rate of evolution. For advantageous intermediate mutants, spatial
interactions always delay the evolution of complex traits, in both
the Moran and contact processes. The role of the mutant islands here
is the opposite: instead of protecting, they constrict the growth
of mutants. We conclude that the laws of population growth can be
crucial for the effect of spatial interactions on the rate of evolution,
and we relate the two processes explored here to different biological
situations.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we derive analytic solutions of stochastic mutation-selection
networks that describe early events of cancer formation. A main assumption
is that cancer is initiated in tissue compartments, where only a
relatively small number of cells are at risk of mutating into cells
that escape from homeostatic regulation. In this case, the evolutionary
dynamics can be approximated by a low-dimensional stochastic process
with a linear Kolmogorov forward equation that can be solved analytically.
Most of the time, the cell population is homogeneous with respect
to relevant mutations. Occasionally, such homogeneous states are
connected by 'stochastic tunnels'. We give a precise analysis of
the existence of tunnels and calculate the rate of tunneling. Finally,
we calculate the conditions for chromosomal instability (CIN) to
precede inactivation of the first tumor suppressor gene. In this
case, CIN is an early event and a driving force of cancer progression.
The techniques developed in this paper can be used to study arbitrarily
complex mutation-selection networks of the somatic evolution of cancer.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This report provides detailed information on how the 2000
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts for
the United States were developed, expanding upon the report that
accompanied the initial release of the charts in 2000. METHODS: The
growth charts were developed with data from five national health
examination surveys and limited supplemental data. Smoothed percentile
curves were developed in two stages. In the first stage, selected
empirical percentiles were smoothed with a variety of parametric
and nonparametric procedures. In the second stage, parameters were
created to obtain the final curves, additional percentiles and z-scores.
The revised charts were evaluated using statistical and graphical
measures. RESULTS: The 1977 National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) growth charts were revised for infants (birth to 36 months)
and older children (2 to 20 years). New body mass index-for-age (BMI-for-age)
charts were created. Use of national data improved the transition
from the infant charts to those for older children. The evaluation
of the charts found no large or systematic differences between the
smoothed percentiles and the empirical data. CONCLUSION: The 2000
CDC growth charts were developed with improved data and statistical
procedures. Health care providers now have an instrument for growth
screening that better represents the racial-ethnic diversity and
combination of breast- and formula-feeding in the United States.
It is recommended that these charts replace the 1977 NCHS charts
when assessing the size and growth patterns of infants, children,
and adolescents.},

   abstract = {Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common and malignant primary brain
tumors and are aggressively treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and
radiotherapy. Despite this treatment, recurrence is inevitable and
survival has improved minimally over the last 50 years. Recent studies
have suggested that GBMs exhibit both heterogeneity and instability
of differentiation states and varying sensitivities of these states
to radiation. Here, we employed an iterative combined theoretical
and experimental strategy that takes into account tumor cellular
heterogeneity and dynamically acquired radioresistance to predict
the effectiveness of different radiation schedules. Using this model,
we identified two delivery schedules predicted to significantly improve
efficacy by taking advantage of the dynamic instability of radioresistance.
These schedules led to superior survival in mice. Our interdisciplinary
approach may also be applicable to other human cancer types treated
with radiotherapy and, hence, may lay the foundation for significantly
increasing the effectiveness of a mainstay of oncologic therapy.

   abstract = {Abstract: Strong reciprocity, defined as a predisposition to help
others and to punish those that are not helping, has been proposed
as a potent force leading to the evolution of cooperation and altruism.
However, the conditions under which strong reciprocity might be favored
are not clear. Here we investigate the selective pressure on strong
reciprocity by letting both limited dispersal (i.e., spatial structure)
and recombination between helping and punishment jointly determine
the evolutionary dynamics of strong reciprocity. Our analytical model
suggests that when helping and punishment are perfectly linked traits
(no recombination occurring between them), strong reciprocity can
spread even when the initial frequency of strong reciprocators is
close to 0 in the population (i.e., a rare mutant can invade). By
contrast, our results indicate that when recombination can occur
between helping and punishment (i.e., both traits coevolve) and is
stronger than selection, punishment is likely to invade a population
of defectors only when it gives a direct fitness benefit to the actor.
Overall, our results delineate the conditions under which strong
reciprocity is selected for in a spatially structured population
and highlight that the forces behind its evolution involves kinship
(be it genetic or cultural).},

reproduction-enhancing resources, and it may have affected human
evolution. Here, we develop a population-genetic model for the coevolution
of costly male belligerence and bravery when war occurs between groups
of individuals in a spatially subdivided population. Belligerence
is assumed to increase an actor&#039;s group probability of trying
to conquer another group. An actor&#039;s bravery is assumed to increase
his group&#039;s ability to conquer an attacked group. We show that
the selective pressure on these two traits can be substantial even
in groups of large size, and that they may be driven by two independent
reproduction-enhancing resources: additional mates for males and
additional territory (or material resources) for females. This has
consequences for our understanding of the evolution of intertribal
interactions, as hunter-gatherer societies are well known to have
frequently raided neighbouring groups from whom they appropriated
territory, goods and women.Keywords:},

follicular lymphoma, couples the bcl-2 protooncogene on chromosome
18 to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain joining region (JH). This results
in a deregulated transcription rate of bcl-2, suggesting a major
role of the t(14;18) translocation in lymphomagenesis. By using a
sensitive polymerase chain reaction technique specific for the major
breakpoint region t(14;18), we now demonstrate the presence of bcl-2/JH
rearrangements in lymph nodes and tonsils with follicular hyperplasia
in 13 of 24 cases (54%). The approximate frequency was one translocation-positive
cell in 10(5) cells. No bcl-2/JH rearrangements were detected in
reactive lymph nodes without follicular hyperplasia or in bone marrow
cells. Sequence analysis showed the amplified bcl-2/JH fragments
to be unique to each individual sample and distinct from 24 sequenced
follicular lymphoma-derived t(14;18) junctions, thus excluding contamination
artifacts. The presence of random nucleotide insertions at the breakpoint
junctions suggests a pre-B-cell origin of the t(14;18) translocation,
in analogy with follicular lymphomas. We conclude that the t(14;18)
translocation can occur in non-malignant tissue and will not, on
its own, lead to malignancy.},

in human cancers and is associated with tumor aggression and poor
clinical outcome. The effect of high levels of c-Myc on global gene
regulation is poorly understood but is widely thought to involve
newly activated or repressed "Myc target genes." We report here that
in tumor cells expressing high levels of c-Myc the transcription
factor accumulates in the promoter regions of active genes and causes
transcriptional amplification, producing increased levels of transcripts
within the cell's gene expression program. Thus, rather than binding
and regulating a new set of genes, c-Myc amplifies the output of
the existing gene expression program. These results provide an explanation
for the diverse effects of oncogenic c-Myc on gene expression in
different tumor cells and suggest that transcriptional amplification
reduces rate-limiting constraints for tumor cell growth and proliferation.},

   abstract = {Techniques which identify hapten-specific B cells in tissues have
been used to determine the sites of B cell activation in rat spleens
in response to T cell-dependent (TD) antigens and T cell-independent
type-1 (TI-1) antigens. Surface-associated hapten binding by specific
memory B cells and B blasts was distinguished from the strong cytoplasmic
hapten binding by specific plasma cells and plasmablasts. Blast cells
in S phase were identified in tissue sections by staining cells which
had been pulse labeled in vivo with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine. Hapten-specific
B blast cells are found in three sites: (a) around interdigitating
cells in the T cell-rich zones; (b) in the follicular dendritic cell
network and (c) in association with macrophages in the red pulp.
Hapten-binding memory B cells, which are not in cell cycle, accumulate
in the marginal zones and to a lesser extent the follicular mantles
in response to TD and TI-1 antigens. The hapten-specific blast response
in T zones is confined to the first few days after antigen is given
and is low for primary responses to TD antigens, but massive on secondary
challenge, when marginal zone memory B cells migrate to the T zones.
Both the primary and secondary T zone responses to TI-1 antigens
are impressive and in these responses hapten-specific B blasts are
also found in the splenic red pulp. The follicular response to TD
antigens starts with a small number of B blasts (fewer than five)
entering each follicle. These increase in number exponentially so
that by the 4th day after immunization they fill the follicle. The
oligoclonality of the response is shown in simultaneous responses
to two haptens where 6%-31% of the follicles on day 3 after immunization
contain blasts specific for only one of the two haptens. During the
4th day classical zonal pattern of germinal centers develops. The
surface immunoglobulin-positive B blasts are lost from the follicle
center, while one pole of the follicular dendritic cell network fills
with surface immunoglobulin-negative centroblasts. Centroblasts do
not increase in numbers but divide to give rise to centrocytes, which
re-express sIg and migrate into the follicular dendritic cell network.
Cell kinetic studies indicate that the centrocyte population is renewed
from centroblasts every 7 h. Centrocytes either leave the germinal
center within this time or die in situ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400

   abstract = {Why don't asexual females replace sexual females in most natural populations
of eukaryotes? One promising explanation is that parasites could
counter the reproductive advantages of asexual reproduction by exerting
frequency-dependent selection against common clones (the Red Queen
hypothesis). One apparent limitation of the Red Queen theory, however,
is that parasites would seem to be required by theory to be highly
virulent. In the present study, I present a population-dynamic view
of competition between sexual females and asexual females that interact
with co-evolving parasites. The results show that asexual populations
have higher carrying capacities, and more unstable population dynamics,
than sexual populations. The results also suggest that the spread
of a clone into a sexual population could increase the effective
parasite virulence as population density increases. This combination
of parasite-mediated frequency-dependent selection, and density-dependent
virulence, could lead to the coexistence of sexual and asexual reproductive
strategies and the long-term persistence of sex.},

   abstract = {I present a historical review of coevolutionary models for the evolutionary
persistence of sexual reproduction. The focus is on the fate of obligately
sexual populations facing competition with one or more obligately
asexual clones. An early simulation model by Hamilton (Hamilton WD.
1980. Sex versus non-sex versus parasite. Oikos. 35:282--290.) suggested
that parasites could be an important force in selecting against asexual
clones, leading to the persistence of sex. This result was consistent
with a number of independent verbal models generated from 1975--1983.
Conversely, the models by May and Anderson (May RM, Anderson RM.
1983. Epidemiology and genetics in the coevolution of parasites and
hosts. Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 219:281--313.), which included
more epidemiological detail, suggested that parasites were an unlikely
source of selection to favor sexual over asexual reproduction. Thus
began an oscillation of opinion regarding the role of parasites in
selection for sex. It would seem at present that some of the differences
of opinion over time stemmed from the different ways that models
were constructed, including whether the sexual population was in
competition with a genetically diverse asexual population or a single
clonal genotype. On theoretical grounds, parasite-mediated selection
for sex seems more likely if the sexual population has options in
genotypic space that are not available to the clones. Models that
incorporate more ecological realism also seem more favorable to the
parasite theory of sex.},

   abstract = {Burkitt lymphoma is characterized by deregulation of MYC, but the
contribution of other genetic mutations to the disease is largely
unknown. Here, we describe the first completely sequenced genome
from a Burkitt lymphoma tumor and germline DNA from the same affected
individual. We further sequenced the exomes of 59 Burkitt lymphoma
tumors and compared them to sequenced exomes from 94 diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tumors. We identified 70 genes that were
recurrently mutated in Burkitt lymphomas, including ID3, GNA13, RET,
PIK3R1 and the SWI/SNF genes ARID1A and SMARCA4. Our data implicate
a number of genes in cancer for the first time, including CCT6B,
SALL3, FTCD and PC. ID3 mutations occurred in 34% of Burkitt lymphomas
and not in DLBCLs. We show experimentally that ID3 mutations promote
cell cycle progression and proliferation. Our work thus elucidates

of colorectal cancers in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results registry, which covers approximately 10% of the U.S. population,
while simultaneously adjusting for birth cohort and calendar year
effects. The incidence of colorectal cancers in the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results registry is most consistent with a
model positing two rare events followed by a high-frequency event
in the conversion of a normal stem cell into an initiated cell that
expands clonally to give rise to an adenomatous polyp. Only one more
rare event appears to be necessary for malignant transformation.
The two rare events involved in initiation are interpreted to represent
the homozygous loss of adenomatous polyposis coli gene function.
The subsequent transition of a preinitiated stem cell into an initiated
cell capable of clonal expansion via symmetric division is predicted
to occur with a frequency too high for a mutational event but may
reflect a positional effect in colonic crypts. Our results suggest
it is not necessary to invoke genomic instability to explain colorectal
cancer incidence rates in human populations. Temporal trends in the
incidence of colon cancer appear to be dominated by calendar year
effects. The model also predicts that interventions, such as administration
of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, designed to decrease the
growth rate of adenomatous polyps, are very efficient at lowering
colon cancer risk substantially, even when begun later in life. By
contrast, interventions that decrease the rate of mutations at the
adenomatous polyposis coli locus are much less effective in reducing
the risk of colon cancer.},

in addition to the MYC translocations t(8;14)(q24;q32), t(8;22)(q24;q11),
and t(2;8)(p11;q24) in 60%-80% of Burkitt lymphomas/leukemias (BL).
The high incidence of such aberrations indicates that additional
changes are important, perhaps necessary, for malignant transformation,
i.e., the 8q24/MYC rearrangements may not be sufficient. To investigate
this possibility, we performed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
array analysis on 20 cases of 8q24/MYC-positive BL. Nineteen (95%)
harbored genomic imbalances; the only case without such aberrations
displayed secondary changes by chromosome banding analysis. Thus,
all BL cases had abnormalities in addition to the 8q24 translocation.
The adult cases harbored more changes (median 3; range 1-21) than
did the childhood cases (median 1.5; range 0-5) (P = 0.034). Several
recurrent aberrations were detected by SNP array analysis, in particular
losses of 6q14.1-q22.33, 9p21.3, and 13q14.2-q14.3, gains of 1q23.3-q31.3,
chromosome 7, 13q31.3, and partial uniparental isodisomies for 6p12.2-pter,
9p23-pter, and 17p11.2-pter. The molecular genetic consequences of
these changes include deletions of the CDKN2A and TP53 genes, and
gains/losses of several genes, such as MIR17HG and E2F2K, involved
in the MYC pathway. Thus, deregulation of the MYC pathway, both directly
through the 8q24/MYC translocation and indirectly through secondary
genomic imbalances, may be essential not only for the initiation
but also for the progression of BL.},

   abstract = {Several empirical studies have shown that the animal group size distribution
of many species can be well fit by power laws with exponential truncation.
A striking empirical result due to Niwa is that the exponent in these
power laws is one and the truncation is determined by the average
group size experienced by an individual. This distribution is known
as the logarithmic distribution. In this paper we provide first principles
derivation of the logarithmic distribution and other truncated power
laws using a site-based merge and split framework. In particular,
we investigate two such models. Firstly, we look at a model in which
groups merge whenever they meet but split with a constant probability
per time step. This generates a distribution similar, but not identical
to the logarithmic distribution. Secondly, we propose a model, based
on preferential attachment, that produces the logarithmic distribution
exactly. Our derivation helps explain why logarithmic distributions
are so widely observed in nature. The derivation also allows us to
link splitting and joining behavior to the exponent and truncation
parameters in power laws.},

   abstract = {It is now widely recognized that cancer development is a protracted
process requiring the stepwise acquisition of multiple oncogenic
events. In humans, this process can take decades, if not a lifetime,
blurring the notion of 'healthy' individuals. Follicular lymphoma
exemplifies this multistep pathway of oncogenesis. In recent years,
variants of follicular lymphoma have been recognized that appear
to represent clonal B-cell expansions at an early stage of follicular
lymphoma lymphomagenesis. These include follicular lymphoma in situ,
duodenal follicular lymphoma, partial involvement by follicular lymphoma,
and in the blood circulating follicular lymphoma-like B cells. Recent
genetic studies have identified similarities and differences between
the early lesions and overt follicular lymphoma, providing important
information for understanding their biological evolution. The data
indicate that there is already genomic instability at these early
stages, even in instances with a low risk for clinical progression.
The overexpression of BCL2 in t(14;18)-positive B cells puts them
at risk for subsequent genetic aberrations when they re-enter the
germinal center and are exposed to the influences of activation-induced
cytidine deaminase and somatic hypermutations. The emerging data
provide a rationale for clinical management and, in the future, may
identify genetic risk factors that warrant early therapeutic intervention.},

   abstract = {During eukaryotic cellular protein synthesis, ribosomal translation is made more efficient through interaction between the two ends of the messenger RNA (mRNA). Ribosomes reaching the 3' end of the mRNA can thus recycle and begin translation again on the same mRNA, the so-called {\textquoteleft}closed-loop{\textquoteright} model. Using a driven diffusion lattice model of translation, we study the effects of ribosome recycling on the dynamics of ribosome flow and density on the mRNA. We show that ribosome recycling induces a substantial increase in ribosome current. Furthermore, for sufficiently large values of the recycling rate, the lattice does not transition directly from low to high ribosome density, as seen in lattice models without recycling. Instead, a maximal current phase becomes accessible for much lower values of the initiation rate, and multiple phase transitions occur over a wide region of the phase plane. Crucially, we show that in the presence of ribosome recycling, mRNAs can exhibit a peak in protein production at low values of the initiation rate, beyond which translation rate decreases. This has important implications for translation of certain mRNAs, suggesting that there is an optimal concentration of ribosomes at which protein synthesis is maximal, and beyond which translational efficiency is impaired.},

   abstract = {Cancer results from a sequence of genetic and epigenetic changes which
lead to a variety of abnormal phenotypes including increased proliferation
and survival of somatic cells, and thus, to a selective advantage
of pre-cancerous cells. The notion of cancer progression as an evolutionary
process has been experiencing increasing interest in recent years.
Many efforts have been made to better understand and predict the
progression to cancer using mathematical models; these mostly consider
the evolution of a well-mixed cell population, even though pre-cancerous
cells often evolve in highly structured epithelial tissues. In this
study, we propose a novel model of cancer progression that considers
a spatially structured cell population where clones expand via adaptive
waves. This model is used to assess two different paradigms of asexual
evolution that have been suggested to delineate the process of cancer
progression. The standard scenario of periodic selection assumes
that driver mutations are accumulated strictly sequentially over
time. However, when the mutation supply is sufficiently high, clones
may arise simultaneously on distinct genetic backgrounds, and clonal
adaptation waves interfere with each other. We find that in the presence
of clonal interference, spatial structure increases the waiting time
for cancer, leads to a patchwork structure of non-uniformly sized
clones, decreases the survival probability of virtually neutral (passenger)
mutations, and that genetic distance begins to increase over a characteristic
length scale L(c). These characteristic features of clonal interference
may help to predict the onset of cancers with pronounced spatial
structure and to interpret spatially-sampled genetic data obtained
from biopsies. Our estimates suggest that clonal interference likely
occurs in the progression of colon cancer, and possibly other cancers
where spatial structure matters.},

Southern blot analysis of the various Ig chain genes demonstrated
homozygous deletion of the Jkappa gene, germ line configuration of
the Jlambda and rearrangement of IgJH genes. Cytogenetic analysis
of both primary leukemic bone marrow and BALM-27 cells showed the

lymphoma. The established cell line BALM-27 represents a rich resource
of abundant, accessible, and manipulable cell material for analyzing
the unique expression of Ig chain and for investigating the pathogenesis
of B-cell malignancy. The scientific significance of BALM-27 lies
in (1) the rarity of this type of leukemia cell lines, and (2) its
unique chromosomal aberrations.},

   abstract = {High-affinity antibodies are generated in germinal centers in a process
involving mutation and selection of B cells. Information processing
in germinal center reactions has been investigated in a number of
recent experiments. These have revealed cell migration patterns,
asymmetric cell divisions, and cell-cell interaction characteristics,
used here to develop a theory of germinal center B cell selection,
division, and exit (the LEDA model). According to this model, B cells
selected by T follicular helper cells on the basis of successful
antigen processing always return to the dark zone for asymmetric
division, and acquired antigen is inherited by one daughter cell
only. Antigen-retaining B cells differentiate to plasma cells and
leave the germinal center through the dark zone. This theory has
implications for the functioning of germinal centers because compared
to previous models, high-affinity antibodies appear one day earlier
and the amount of derived plasma cells is considerably larger.},

and -negative homosexual men for the presence of T(8;14) translocations
that recombine c-myc and immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) mu/IgH
alpha switch regions. Clones with T(8;14) translocations were detected
in 10.5% (12/114) of the HIV-positive and in 2.0% of the 99 uninfected
patients. The majority of recombinations were found at a single time
point only. Four patients, however, harbored multiple (up to four)
and persistent (up to 9 years) translocation-positive cell clones.
No correlation between the presence of these aberrant lymphocytes
and a later lymphoma could be established. The exon 1/intron 1 region
of the recombined c-myc was investigated for the presence of point
mutations and these were found in the nonpersistent clones. Additional
alterations detected in these clones included duplications and a
deletion in the c-myc gene. The pattern of base substitution indicates
that they were introduced after the translocation event.},

loci to the c-myc protooncogene are the hallmark of Burkitt lymphomas
(BLs), whether they carry the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) or not. Ig/myc
translocations occur as accidents of normal B lymphocyte differentiation.
Unless protected, the translocation carrying cells are apoptosis
prone. However, the high B cell stimulatory cytokine level found
in the two BL prone conditions, in chronic hyperendemic malaria and
HIV infection, may rescue them. X-linked lymphoproliferative disease
(XLP) is due to the lack of functional SAP protein, a consequence
of mutation or deletion of the SAP gene. We and others have shown
that SAP is pro-apoptotic. Here we summarize our finding that 8 of
10 EBV carrying, but none of 9 EBV negative BL lines express SAP.
We suggest that the apoptosis prone Ig/myc translocation carrying
EBV negative precursors of BL can only grow into lymphomas if they
do not express SAP. However, their EBV positive counterparts are
permissive for SAP expression, due to the anti-apoptotic function
of EBNA-1.},

share of cooperators in the population should also increase. It is
well known that positive assortment between cooperative types, for
instance in spatially structured populations, provide better conditions
for the evolution of cooperation than complete mixing. This study
demonstrates that, assuming positive assortment, under most conditions
higher cooperation benefits also increase the share of cooperators.
On the other hand, under a specified range of payoff values, when
at least two payoff parameters are modified, the reverse is true.
The conditions for this paradox are determined for two-person social
dilemmas: the Prisoner's Dilemma, the Hawks and Doves game, and the
Stag Hunt game, assuming global selection and positive assortment.},

   abstract = {The c-Myc HLH-bZIP protein has been implicated in physiological or
pathological growth, proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism, and differentiation
at the cellular, tissue, or organismal levels via regulation of numerous
target genes. No principle yet unifies Myc action due partly to an
incomplete inventory and functional accounting of Myc's targets.
To observe Myc target expression and function in a system where Myc
is temporally and physiologically regulated, the transcriptomes and
the genome-wide distributions of Myc, RNA polymerase II, and chromatin
modifications were compared during lymphocyte activation and in ES
cells as well. A remarkably simple rule emerged from this quantitative
analysis: Myc is not an on-off specifier of gene activity, but is
a nonlinear amplifier of expression, acting universally at active
genes, except for immediate early genes that are strongly induced
before Myc. This rule of Myc action explains the vast majority of
Myc biology observed in literature.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Karyotypic abnormalities in sporadic Burkitt lymphoma
(BL) have been described extensively. However, to the authors' knowledge,
very limited studies have focused on the secondary chromosomal abnormalities
in pediatric BL as compared with those of adult BL and on their prognostic
impact. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in all pediatric
and adult patients at 2 institutions, with a morphologic diagnosis
of BL, pretherapy tumor karyotype available, and t(8;14), t(8;22),
or t(2;8) present. RESULTS: There were 33 children and 37 adults.
The majority of the patients (95%) had Stage III/IV disease. There
were no statistically significant differences noted in karyotype
complexity and the nature of the chromosomal abnormalities between
these 2 groups. Abnormalities of chromosomes 13 (13q) and 22 (22q)
had a negative impact on prognosis in children. In adults, abnormalities
of chromosome 17 appeared to have a negative impact. CONCLUSIONS:
The current findings suggest that karyotypic information can be used
for refining risk stratification in patients with BL.},

   abstract = {Theoretical ecologists have long sought to understand how the persistence
of populations depends on biotic and abiotic factors. Classical work
showed that demographic stochasticity causes the mean time to extinction
to increase exponentially with population size, whereas variation
in environmental conditions can lead to a power-law scaling. Recent
work has focused especially on the influence of the autocorrelation
structure ('color') of environmental noise. In theoretical physics,
there is a burst of research activity in analyzing large fluctuations
in stochastic population dynamics. This research provides powerful
tools for determining extinction times and characterizing the pathway
to extinction. It yields, therefore, sharp insights into extinction
processes and has great potential for further applications in theoretical
biology.},

To further encourage such pro-social behaviors, recipients often respond by providing additional incentives, for example by offering rewards. Although such incentives facilitate cooperation, the question remains how these incentivizing behaviors themselves evolve, and whether they would always be used responsibly. Herein, we consider a simple model to systematically study the co-evolution of cooperation and different rewarding policies. In our model, both social and antisocial behaviors can be rewarded, but individuals gain a reputation for how they reward others. By characterizing the game's equilibria and by simulating evolutionary learning processes, we find that reputation effects systematically favor cooperation and social rewarding. While our baseline model applies to pairwise interactions in well-mixed populations, we obtain similar conclusions under assortment, or when individuals interact in larger groups. According to our model, rewards are most effective when they sway others to cooperate. This view is consistent with empirical observations suggesting that people reward others to ultimately benefit themselves.},

When considering a single final resistant genotype, epistatic contingencies among mutations restrict evolution to a small number of adaptive paths. Less attention has been given to multi-peak landscapes, and while specific peaks can be favoured, it is unknown whether and how early a commitment to final fate is made. Here we characterize a multi-peaked adaptive landscape for trimethoprim resistance by constructing all combinatorial alleles of seven resistance-conferring mutations in dihydrofolate reductase. We observe that epistatic interactions increase rather than decrease the accessibility of each peak; while they restrict the number of direct paths, they generate more indirect paths, where mutations are adaptively gained and later adaptively lost or changed. This enhanced accessibility allows evolution to proceed through many adaptive steps while delaying commitment to genotypic fate, hindering our ability to predict or control evolutionary outcomes.},

depend on the assumption that pathogens are narrowly specialized,
so that high fitness on one host genotype results in poor fitness
on hosts with other allele combinations. This assumption is necessary
in order for frequency-dependent selection to produce sustained cycling
of gametic disequilibrium across the host's disease resistance loci,
which makes recombination advantageous. However, a review of numerous
genetic studies on plant disease resistance failed to uncover a single
example consistent with this assumption. Instead, the empirical results
provide strong support for a different pattern of pathogen specificity,
in which adaptation by pathogens to one resistance allele does not
preclude high fitness on alternate host genotypes lacking that allele.
Modification of traditional models for pathogen-mediated evolution
of sex showed that for conditions close to the empirical pattern
of genotypic specificity, sex is almost never favoured. For plants,
these results cast doubt on current theories arguing that pathogens

a particular case where the oscillation cycles are marginally stable
on the mean-field level. An iconic example of such a system is the
Lotka-Volterra model of predator-prey interaction. Fluctuation effects
due to discreteness of the populations destroy the mean-field stability
and eventually drive the system toward extinction of one or both
species. We show that the corresponding extinction time scales as
a certain power-law of the population sizes. This behavior should
be contrasted with the extinction of models stable in the mean-field
approximation. In the latter case the extinction time scales exponentially
with size.},

a reversible transgenic model of pancreatic beta cell oncogenesis
using a switchable form of the c-Myc protein. Activation of c-Myc
in adult, mature beta cells induces uniform beta cell proliferation
but is accompanied by overwhelming apoptosis that rapidly erodes
beta cell mass. Thus, the oncogenic potential of c-Myc in beta cells
is masked by apoptosis. Upon suppression of c-Myc-induced beta cell
apoptosis by coexpression of Bcl-x(L), c-Myc triggers rapid and uniform
progression into angiogenic, invasive tumors. Subsequent c-Myc deactivation
induces rapid regression associated with vascular degeneration and
beta cell apoptosis. Our data indicate that highly complex neoplastic
lesions can be both induced and maintained in vivo by a simple combination
of two interlocking molecular lesions.},

societies, are inherently more complex than interactions among particles
and non-living matter. Group interactions are a particularly important
and widespread class, representative of which is the public goods
game. In addition, methods of statistical physics have proved valuable
for studying pattern formation, equilibrium selection and self-organization
in evolutionary games. Here, we review recent advances in the study
of evolutionary dynamics of group interactions on top of structured
populations, including lattices, complex networks and coevolutionary
models. We also compare these results with those obtained on well-mixed
populations. The review particularly highlights that the study of
the dynamics of group interactions, like several other important
equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamical processes in biological,
economical and social sciences, benefits from the synergy between
statistical physics, network science and evolutionary game theory.},

hyperplane is investigated herein. There exists a fundamental difference
between the even- and the odd-dimensional case. For even dimensions
the dynamics are generated by a Hamiltonian system with respect to
an appropriately chosen Poisson structure. For odd dimensions the
dynamics are Hamiltonian if there is a continuum of interior fixed
points, and gradient-like if the interior fixed point is unique.
In this case the invariant hyperplane is part of the ω -limit set,
and the dynamics restricted to this set are those of a Hamiltonian
system. Furthermore, an example of a completely integrable four-dimensional
Hamiltonian Lotka-Volterra system is presented.},

is required for the evolution of cooperation. However, local competition
among relatives can limit cooperative benefits, antagonizing the
evolution of cooperation. We show that several ecological factors
determine the extent to which kin competition constrains cooperative
benefits. In addition, we argue that cooperative acts that expand
local carrying capacity are less constrained by kin competition than
other cooperative traits, and are therefore more likely to evolve.
These arguments are particularly relevant to microbial cooperation,
which often involves the production of public goods that promote
population expansion. The challenge now is to understand how an organism's
ecology influences how much cooperative groups contribute to future
generations and thereby the evolution of cooperation.},

   abstract = {The germinal centre reaction (GCR) is a fundamental component of the
immune response to T-dependent antigens, during which the immunoglobulin
(Ig) genes of B cells experience somatic hypermutation and selection.
A maximum-likelihood method on DNA sequence data from 16 individual
germinal centres was used to infer that the waiting time for position
33 key (high-affinity) mutations in the anti-(4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)
acetyl (NP) response is 8.3 days. This is in marked contrast to the
prediction of a key mutant each generation (waiting time about 1/3
day) obtained from a simple model and parameters available in the
literature. This disagreement is resolved in part by the finding
that the targeted base occurs in a cold spot for hypermutation, raising
the predicted waiting time to 2.3 days, although this value remains
significantly lower than that inferred from the sequence data. It
is proposed that the remaining disparity is attributable to some
further stochastic process in the GCR: many early key mutations arise
but fail to 'take root' within the GC, either due to emigration or
failure of cognate T cell/B cell interaction. Furthermore, it is
argued that the frequency with which position 33 mutations are found
in secondary responses to NP indicates the presence of selection
after the GCR.},

conflicts under conditions of intergroup competition. The paradigm
constitutes an n-person game with imperfect and incomplete information
in which the n players are divided into two groups, are each assigned
monetary endowment, and must then decide independently and anonymously
whether to keep the endowment or contribute it to the group's benefit.
The group with the larger sum of contributions is provided with a
monetary reward (binary public good), which is shared equally among
all of its members regardless of their decision. Two alternative
models are proposed and their testable implications are derived and
discussed. Both assume maximization of expected utility, but their
assumptions about the expectations each player holds about the decisions
of the remaining players are different. The effects of predecisional
communication are examined and several extensions of the basic paradigm
are outlined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights

   abstract = {Population structure affects the relative influence of selection and
drift on the change in allele frequencies. Several models have been
proposed recently, using diffusion approximations to calculate fixation
probabilities, fixation times, and equilibrium properties of subdivided
populations. We propose here a simple method to construct diffusion
approximations in structured populations; it relies on general expressions
for the expectation and variance in allele frequency change over
one generation, in terms of partial derivatives of a ``fitness function''
and probabilities of genetic identity evaluated in a neutral model.
In the limit of a very large number of demes, these probabilities
can be expressed as functions of average allele frequencies in the
metapopulation, provided that coalescence occurs on two different
timescales, which is the case in the island model. We then use the
method to derive expressions for the probability of fixation of new
mutations, as a function of their dominance coefficient, the rate
of partial selfing, and the rate of deme extinction. We obtain more
precise approximations than those derived by recent work, in particular
(but not only) when deme sizes are small. Comparisons with simulations
show that the method gives good results as long as migration is stronger
than selection.},

   abstract = {The genetic hallmark of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is the t(8;14)(q24;q32)
and its variants leading to activation of the MYC oncogene. It is
a matter of debate whether true BL without MYC translocation exists.
Here, we identified 59 lymphomas concordantly called BL by 2 gene
expression classifiers among 753 B-cell lymphomas. Only 2 (3%) of
these 59 molecular BL lacked a MYC translocation, which both shared
a peculiar pattern of chromosome 11q aberration characterized by
interstitial gains including 11q23.2-q23.3 and telomeric losses of
11q24.1-qter. We extended our analysis to 17 MYC-negative high-grade
B-cell lymphomas with a similar 11q aberration and showed this aberration
to be recurrently associated with morphologic and clinical features
of BL. The minimal region of gain was defined by high-level amplifications
in 11q23.3 and associated with overexpression of genes including
PAFAH1B2 on a transcriptional and protein level. The recurrent region
of loss contained a focal homozygous deletion in 11q24.2-q24.3 including
the ETS1 gene, which was shown to be mutated in 4 of 16 investigated
cases. These findings indicate the existence of a molecularly distinct
subset of B-cell lymphomas reminiscent of BL, which is characterized
by deregulation of genes in 11q.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Burkitt's lymphoma is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma characterized
by typical morphological, immunophenotypic and molecular features.
Gene expression profiling provided a molecular signature of Burkitt's
lymphoma, but also demonstrated that a subset of aggressive B-cell
lymphomas not fulfilling the current World Health Organization criteria
for the diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma nonetheless show a molecular
signature of Burkitt's lymphoma ('discrepant Burkitt's lymphoma').
Given the different treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large
B-cell lymphomas we investigated molecular differences within gene
expression-defined Burkitt's lymphoma. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied
tumors from 51 Burkitt's lymphoma patients, comprising 26 with classic
Burkitt's lymphoma, 17 with atypical Burkitt's lymphoma and 8 with
'discrepant Burkitt's lymphoma', by comparative genomic hybridization
and gene expression profiling. RESULTS: Classic and atypical Burkitt's
lymphoma (excluding 'discrepant Burkitt's lymphoma'), in adult and
pediatric cases do not differ in underlying genomic imbalances or
gene expression suggesting that these subgroups are molecularly homogeneous.
'Discrepant Burkitt's lymphoma', however, differ dramatically in
the absolute number of alterations from classic/atypical Burkitt's
lymphoma and from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Moreover, this category
includes lymphomas that carry both the t(14;18) and t(8;14) translocations
and are clinically characterized by presentation in adult patients
and an aggressive course. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric and adult Burkitt's
lymphoma are molecularly homogeneous, whereas 'discrepant Burkitt's
lymphoma' differ in underlying genetic and clinical features from
typical/atypical Burkitt's lymphoma. 'Discrepant Burkitt's lymphoma'
may therefore form a distinct genetic subgroup of aggressive B-cell
lymphomas, which show poor response to multi-agent chemotherapy.},

   abstract = {It has long been recognized that the border between classical Burkitt's
lymphoma (BL) and classical diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
is hard to determine. Instead, both classical lymphoma entities seem
to be the extreme ends of a spectrum of diseases that contains a
group of lymphomas characterized predominately by the fact that they
are hard to assign to the one or the other group. This gray zone
has been recently termed "lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features
intermediate between DLBCL and BL" by the updated WHO classification.
The term "intermediate" resembles that from a recent gene-expression
study of mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas, although, notably, it
is used differently. Intermediate lymphomas according to the WHO
classification clearly are a temporary container of different biologic
subtypes of aggressive lymphoma, from which several might be associated
with an unfavorable clinical outcome. The present review aims at
describing the morphologic, clinical, and biologic heterogeneity
of the intermediate lymphomas and, moreover, attempts to propose
testable subgroups based on age and presence of genetic aberrations.},

   abstract = {A traditional picture of evolutionary dynamics with constant fitness
is that of genomes living in sequence space and adapting on fitness
landscapes. Mutation rates are considered to be constant or externally
regulated. If, however, we take into account that genomes also encode
for enzymes that perform replication and error correction, then individual
genomes not only have a specific replication rate (fitness), but
also a specific mutation rate. This leads to the concept of a mutation
landscape. We explore evolution on mutation landscapes. Localization
in pure mutation landscapes is only possible under extremely restrictive
conditions. Coupling of mutation landscapes and fitness landscapes
leads to localization and hence adaptation and evolution. We analyse
how mutation landscapes facilitate localization in fitness landscapes
and vice versa. Finally, we show that for mutation landscapes, at
equilibrium, with constant environment, there is not necessarily
selection for the minimum mutation rate. Instead, the target of selection
is an optimum distribution of mutation rates, a 'mutational quasispecies'.},

   abstract = {Burkitt lymphoma is a germinal center B-cell-derived cancer that was
instrumental in the identification of MYC as an important human oncogene
more than three decades ago. Recently, new genomics technologies
have uncovered several additional oncogenic mechanisms that cooperate
with MYC to create this highly aggressive cancer. The transcription
factor TCF-3 is central to Burkitt lymphoma pathogenesis. TCF-3 is
rendered constitutively active in Burkitt lymphoma by two related
mechanisms: (1) somatic mutations that inactivate its negative regulator
ID3, and (2) somatic mutations in TCF-3 that block the ability of
ID3 to bind and interfere with its activity as a transcription factor.
TCF-3 is also a master regulator of normal germinal center B-cell
differentiation. Within the germinal center, TCF-3 up-regulates genes
that are characteristically expressed in the rapidly dividing centroblasts,
the putative cell of origin for Burkitt lymphoma, while repressing
genes expressed in the less proliferative centrocytes. TCF-3 promotes
antigen-independent (tonic) B-cell-receptor signaling in Burkitt
lymphoma by transactivating immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain
genes while repressing PTPN6, which encodes the phosphatase SHP-1,
a negative regulator of B-cell-receptor signaling. Tonic B-cell-receptor
signaling sustains Burkitt lymphoma survival by engaging the PI3
kinase pathway. In addition, TCF-3 promotes cell-cycle progression
by transactivating CCND3, encoding a D-type cyclin that regulates
the G1-S phase transition. Additionally, CCND3 accumulates oncogenic
mutations that stabilize cyclin D3 protein expression and drive proliferation.
These new insights into Burkitt lymphoma pathogenesis suggest new
therapeutic strategies, which are sorely needed in developing regions
of the world where this cancer is endemic.},

   abstract = {Understanding how the immune system affects cancer development and
progression has been one of the most challenging questions in immunology.
Research over the past two decades has helped explain why the answer
to this question has evaded us for so long. We now appreciate that
the immune system plays a dual role in cancer: It can not only suppress
tumor growth by destroying cancer cells or inhibiting their outgrowth
but also promote tumor progression either by selecting for tumor
cells that are more fit to survive in an immunocompetent host or
by establishing conditions within the tumor microenvironment that
facilitate tumor outgrowth. Here, we discuss a unifying conceptual
framework called "cancer immunoediting," which integrates the immune
system's dual host-protective and tumor-promoting roles.},

has proceeded along
two distinct lines. Study of navigation generally focuses on the
orientation ability of the individual without reference to the implications
of group membership. A simple principle (the 'many wrongs principle'),
first proposed by Bergman and Donner in 1964, and developed by both
Hamilton and Wallraff three decades ago, provides a link between
these lines of current interest by suggesting that navigational accuracy
increases with group size. With unprecedented scope for testing the
hypotheses it generates, it is now time that the many wrongs principle
is exhumed.},

an increase of cooperation strategy in its strategy distribution,
we deduced that the substance of a dilemma can be expressed by a
productive summation of the static factor and the dynamic factor
independently. A static factor is an element of the game's structure
that influences a possible dilemma, which relates to a game's structural
deviation from a situation where the cooperation strategy can be
weakly dominant over other strategies. In contrast, a dynamic factor
refers to a strategy distribution's influence on the dilemma by affecting
the game dynamics. In a 2 × 2 game, the existence of a dilemma can
be determined only by a static factor. That is, whether or not a
dilemma occurs is related only to the structural effect of the game.
On the other hand, in a more-than-two-strategies game, both static
and dynamic factors determine the occurrence of a dilemma, and the
static factor cannot solely explain the occurrence of a dilemma.},

chemotherapy regimens could be more effective in those cases. Its
evaluation requires cytogenetic or fluorescence in-situ hybridization
(FISH) studies, which are expensive and not widely available. The
aim of this work was to find an immunohistochemical marker able to
be used as a screening tool to identify MYC translocations. METHODS
AND RESULTS: Aggressive B cell lymphomas in which MYC status was
assessed during their diagnostic work-up between 2007 and 2010 were
collected, their immunophenotype was re-evaluated, and were stratified
according to the Hans algorithm. Two tissue microarrays were built
in order to evaluate MYC protein expression with a commercially available
antibody. The study was performed on 56 specimens: nine Burkitt lymphomas
(eight translocated), 45 DLBCLs (nine translocated) and two lymphomas
with intermediate features (both translocated). Only MYC protein
expression detected by immunohistochemistry correlated with MYC translocation.
No relationship was seen between MYC gene copies and protein expression.
CONCLUSIONS: MYC protein expression detected by immunohistochemistry
using a commercially available antibody correlates with MYC gene
translocation, and could be used as a screening tool to select those
cases in which confirmatory genetic testing is mandatory.},

different behavioral strategies? The various approaches to this question
have fallen into one of the following categories: the fixation probability
of a mutant allele in a wild type population, some measures of gene
frequency and gene frequency change, and a formulation of the inclusive
fitness effect. Countless theoretical studies have examined the relationship
between these approaches, and it has generally been thought that,
under standard simplifying assumptions, they yield equivalent results.
Most of this theoretical work, however, has assumed homogeneity of
the population interaction structure---that is, that all individuals
are equivalent. We explore the question of selective advantage in
a general (heterogeneous) population and show that, although appropriate
measures of fixation probability and gene frequency change are equivalent,
they are not, in general, equivalent to the inclusive fitness effect.
The latter does not reflect effects of selection acting via mutation,
which can arise on heterogeneous structures, even for low mutation.
Our theoretical framework provides a transparent analysis of the
different biological factors at work in the comparison of these fitness
measures and suggests that their theoretical and empirical use needs
to be revised and carefully grounded in a more general theory.},

   abstract = {Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a B-cell neoplasm resulting from the transformation
of germinal center (GC) B cells. Although t(14;18) and ectopic B-cell
lymphoma 2 (BCL2) expression constitute the genetic hallmark of FL,
t(14;18)(pos) B cells bearing genotypic and phenotypic features of
FL cells can be found in the blood of most healthy individuals. Nevertheless,
the localization of these FL-like cells (FLLCs) in nonmalignant GC-rich
tissues and the functional consequences of BCL2 overexpression have
not been evaluated thus far. Among 85 reactive lymph node (RLN) samples,
14% were found to contain high levels of t(14;18) by quantitative
polymerase chain reaction. In t(14;18)(hi) RLNs, CD20(pos)BCL2(pos)CD10(pos)
FLLCs consistently accumulated within the GC, essentially as nonproliferative
CXCR4(neg) centrocytes. Moreover, they displayed a reduced response
to proliferative stimuli in vitro. Altogether, our findings provide
new insights into in situ FLLC functional properties and suggest
that these cells have not acquired the ultimate genetic events leading

the genetic composition of the brood of which the individual is a
member, and/or the genotypes of the individual's parents. The model
is formulated such that the fundamental equations describing brood
selection at a single locus in a randomly-mating population are identical
to the equations arising from a frequency-dependent model in population
genetics. Hence, the mathematical analysis of brood selection is
equivalent to that of frequency-dependent selection. In particular,
brood selection results in multiple equilibria that in general do
not maximize average fitness. Several specific examples are discussed,
including social selection against a genetic disease, reproductive
compensation, the evolution of aposematic coloration, and the evolution
of altruistic or selfish brood behavior.},

   abstract = {1 The metapopulation concept is useful when considering ecological
and evolutionary dynamics of spatially structured populations. However,
debate has focused on genetic variation that is neutral rather than
under selection. This distinction is particularly important in antagonistic
or co-evolutionary interactions such as host-pathogen or predator-prey
systems. Plant host-pathogen systems provide some of the best examples
of studies in which numerical and genetic dynamics have been investigated
in a spatially explicit context, and where genes under selection
can be unambiguously identified. 2 Empirical studies of natural host-pathogen
interactions have shown that, while in some cases pathogens appear
to be locally adapted to their hosts, in others there is no local
correspondence between resistance and virulence genes. Recent theory
suggests that the dynamics (epidemic vs. endemic) and migration rates
of host and pathogen will be important factors in the maintenance
of genetic polymorphisms in resistance and virulence. 3 We argue
that the relative spatial scales at which hosts and pathogens interact
are crucial to understanding the evolution of resistance/virulence
structure. Pathogens that disperse further than their hosts will
be more likely to show gene-for-gene interactions than pathogens
dispersing over spatial scales similar to or smaller than their hosts.
4 We predict that life-history features that influence encounter
rates between specific host and pathogen genotypes will be important
factors in determining the evolution of resistance-virulence structures.
In particular, we would expect correlative and/or causal relationships
between pathogen life-history features [e.g. local vs. systemic infection,
type (fecundity vs. mortality) and severity of effects], and whether
dynamics are endemic or epidemic. 5 Plant host-pathogen systems provide
ideal models for investigating the evolution of non-neutral genetic
variation in spatial systems. Understanding the co-evolution of such
systems will require research programmes that integrate long-term
descriptive and experimental studies of multiple populations, with
analytical and computer simulation modelling and comparative/phylogenetic
studies.},

found in tumors may occur before tumor initiation, there is little

this fundamental issue, we formulated a mathematical model for the
evolution of somatic mutations in which all relevant phases of a
tissue's history are considered. The model makes the prediction,
validated by our empirical findings, that the number of somatic mutations
in tumors of self-renewing tissues is positively correlated with
the age of the patient at diagnosis. Importantly, our analysis indicates
that half or more of the somatic mutations in certain tumors of self-renewing
tissues occur before the onset of neoplasia. The model also provides
a unique way to estimate the in vivo tissue-specific somatic mutation
rates in normal tissues directly from the sequencing data of tumors.
Our results have substantial implications for the interpretation
of the large number of genome-wide cancer studies now being undertaken.},

More precisely we show there is a triangular relation between the fields of Multi-Agent Systems, Reinforcement Learning and Evolutionary Game Theory. We illustrate how these new insights can contribute to a better understanding of learning in MAS and to new improved learning algorithms. All three fields are introduced in a self-contained manner. Each relation is discussed in detail with the necessary background information to understand it, along with major references to relevant work. {\textcopyright} 2005 Springer.},

Duke University{\^a}µ* Corresponding author; email: vancleve{at}nescent.orgAbstractThe
evolution of social traits remains one of the most fascinating and
feisty topics in evolutionary biology even after half a century of
theoretical research. W. D. Hamilton shaped much of the field initially
with his 1964 papers that laid out the foundation for understanding
the effect of genetic relatedness on the evolution of social behavior.
Early theoretical investigations revealed two critical assumptions
required for Hamilton&#039;s rule to hold in dynamical models: weak
selection and additive genetic interactions. However, only recently
have analytical approaches from population genetics and evolutionary
game theory developed sufficiently so that social evolution can be
studied under the joint action of selection, mutation, and genetic
drift. We review how these approaches suggest two timescales for
evolution under weak mutation: (i) a short-term timescale where evolution
occurs between a finite set of alleles, and (ii) a long-term timescale
where a continuum of alleles are possible and populations evolve
continuously from one monomorphic trait to another. We show how Hamilton&#039;s
rule emerges from the short-term analysis under additivity and how
non-additive genetic interactions can be accounted for more generally.
This short-term approach reproduces, synthesizes, and generalizes
many previous results including the one-third law from evolutionary
game theory and risk dominance from economic game theory. Using the
long-term approach, we illustrate how trait evolution can be described
with a diffusion equation that is a stochastic analogue of the canonical
equation of adaptive dynamics. Peaks in the stationary distribution
of the diffusion capture classic notions of convergence stability
from evolutionary game theory and generally depend on the additive
genetic interactions inherent in Hamilton&#039;s rule. Surprisingly,
the peaks of the long-term stationary distribution can predict the
effects of simple kinds of non-additive interactions. Additionally,
the peaks may capture the effect of both weak and strong selection
in a manner analogous to classic diffusion approaches in population
genetics. Together, the results from the short and long-term approaches
suggest both how Hamilton&#039;s insight may be robust in unexpected
ways and how current analytical approaches can expand our understanding
of social evolution far beyond Hamilton&#039;s original work.Received

   abstract = {Germline TP53 mutations are responsible for the large majority of
classic LFS families, and a smaller proportion of LFL families. In
some of the families shown to have no germline TP53 mutation, germline
hChk2 mutations have been described. In some cases the functional
consequences of the latter have been demonstrated, although there
are still relatively few reports of such mutations. Due to the paucity
of families currently described with hChk2 mutations, it is not possible
to reach any conclusions concerning the phenotypic/clinical differences
between the two types of germline mutation. At least one family with
a germline hChk2 mutation is a classic LFS family, whereas others
are LFL, variant-LFS, or phenotypically suggestive of LFS. However,
there is still a significant number of LFS/LFL families for which
no underlying genetic determinant has been identified. It will be
fascinating to see what genetic defects are responsible, and whether
they involve additional components of DNA damage recognition, repair,
or cell cycle checkpoint pathways.},

within secondary lymphoid organs that contained mitotic cells. Since
then, it has become clear that this structure is the site of B cell
clonal expansion, somatic hypermutation, and affinity-based selection,
the combination of which results in the production of high-affinity
antibodies. Decades of anatomical and functional studies have led
to an overall model of how the GC reaction and affinity-based selection
operate. More recently, the introduction of intravital imaging into
the GC field has opened the door to direct investigation of certain
key dynamic features of this microanatomic structure, sparking renewed
interest in the relationship between cell movement and affinity maturation.
We review these and other recent advances in our understanding of
GCs, focusing on cellular dynamics and on the mechanism of selection
of high-affinity B cells.},

and selection. GCs are polarized into dark (DZ) and light zones (LZ),
a distinction that is of key importance to GC selection. However,
the difference between the B cells in each of these zones in humans
remains unclear. We show that, as in mice, CXCR4 and CD83 can be
used to distinguish human LZ and DZ cells. Using these markers, we
show that LZ and DZ cells in mice and humans differ only in the expression
of characteristic "activation" and "proliferation" programs, suggesting
that these populations represent alternating states of a single-cell
type rather than distinct differentiation stages. In addition, LZ/DZ
transcriptional profiling shows that, with the exception of "molecular"
Burkitt lymphomas, nearly all human B-cell malignancies closely resemble
LZ cells, which has important implications for our understanding
of the molecular programs of lymphomagenesis.},

induce tumors with a high frequency and can induce massive programmed
cell death (PCD) in most transgenic mouse models, with greater efficiency
than other oncogenes. Evidence also indicates that c-Myc can cause
proliferative inhibition, i.e. mitoinhibition. The c-Myc-induced
PCD and mitoinhibition, which may be attributable to its inhibition
of cyclin D1 and induction of p53, may impose a pressure of compensatory
proliferation, i.e. regeneration, onto the initiated cells (cancer
progenitor cells) that occur sporadically and are resistant to the
mitoinhibition. The initiated cells can thus proliferate robustly
and progress to a malignancy. This hypothetical thinking, i.e. the
concurrent PCD and mitoinhibition induced by c-Myc can promote carcinogenesis,
predicts that an optimal balance is achieved between cell death and
ensuing regeneration during oncogenic transformation by c-Myc, which
can better promote carcinogenesis. In this perspective, we summarize
accumulating evidence and challenge the current model that oncoprotein
induces carcinogenesis by promoting cellular proliferation and/or
inhibiting PCD. Inspired by c-myc oncogene, we surmise that many
tumor-suppressive or growth-inhibitory genes may also be able to
promote carcinogenesis in a similar way, i.e. by inducing PCD and/or
mitoinhibition of normal cells to create a need for compensatory
proliferation that drives a robust replication of initiating cells.},

   abstract = {Why would natural selection favor the prevalence of cooperation within
the groups of selfish individuals? A fruitful framework to address
this question is evolutionary game theory, the essence of which is
captured in the so-called social dilemmas. Such dilemmas have sparked
the development of a variety of mathematical approaches to assess
the conditions under which cooperation evolves. Furthermore, borrowing
from statistical physics and network science, the research of the
evolutionary game dynamics has been enriched with phenomena such
as pattern formation, equilibrium selection, and self-organization.
Numerous advances in understanding the evolution of cooperative behavior
over the last few decades have recently been distilled into five
reciprocity mechanisms: direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity,
kin selection, group selection, and network reciprocity. However,
when social viscosity is introduced into a population via any of
the reciprocity mechanisms, the existing scaling parameters for the
dilemma strength do not yield a unique answer as to how the evolutionary
dynamics should unfold. Motivated by this problem, we review the
developments that led to the present state of affairs, highlight
the accompanying pitfalls, and propose new universal scaling parameters
for the dilemma strength. We prove universality by showing that the
conditions for an ESS and the expressions for the internal equilibriums
in an infinite, well-mixed population subjected to any of the five
reciprocity mechanisms depend only on the new scaling parameters.
A similar result is shown to hold for the fixation probability of
the different strategies in a finite, well-mixed population. Furthermore,
by means of numerical simulations, the same scaling parameters are
shown to be effective even if the evolution of cooperation is considered
on the spatial networks (with the exception of highly heterogeneous
setups). We close the discussion by suggesting promising directions
for future research including (i) how to handle the dilemma strength
in the context of co-evolution and (ii) where to seek opportunities
for applying the game theoretical approach with meaningful impact.},

   abstract = {Although it has been suggested that large animal groups should make
better decisions than smaller groups, there are few empirical demonstrations
of this phenomenon and still fewer explanations of the how these
improvements may be made. Here we show that both speed and accuracy
of decision making increase with group size in fish shoals under
predation threat. We examined two plausible mechanisms for this improvement:
first, that groups are guided by a small proportion of high-quality
decision makers and, second, that group members use self-organized
division of vigilance. Repeated testing of individuals showed no
evidence of different decision-making abilities between individual
fish. Instead, we suggest that shoals achieve greater decision-making
efficiencies through division of labor combined with social information
transfer. Our results should prompt reconsideration of how we view
cooperation in animal groups with fluid membership.},

   abstract = {Many tumors are believed to be maintained by a small number of cancer
stem-like cells, where cure is thought to require eradication of
this cell population. In this study, we investigated the dynamics
of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) before and during therapy with
regard to disease initiation, progression, and therapeutic response.
This investigation used a mathematical model of hematopoiesis and
a dataset derived from the North American Intergroup Study INT0129.
The known phenotypic constraints of APL could be explained by a combination
of differentiation blockade of PML-RARα-positive cells and suppression
of normal hematopoiesis. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) neutralizes
the differentiation block and decreases the proliferation rate of
leukemic stem cells in vivo. Prolonged ATRA treatment after chemotherapy
can cure patients with APL by eliminating the stem-like cell population
over the course of approximately one year. To our knowledge, this
study offers the first estimate of the average duration of therapy
that is required to eliminate stem-like cancer cells from a human
tumor, with the potential for the refinement of treatment strategies
to better manage human malignancy.},

In particular, we analyze the shape of telomere length distributions underlying stem cell behavior within individuals. Our mathematical model shows that these distributions contain a fingerprint of the progressive telomere loss and the fraction of symmetric cell proliferations. Our predictions are tested against measured telomere length distributions in humans across all ages, collected from lymphocyte and granulocyte sorted telomere length data of 356 healthy individuals, including 47 cord blood and 28 bone marrow samples. We find an increasing stem cell pool during childhood and adolescence and an approximately maintained stem cell population in adults. Furthermore, our method is able to detect individual differences from a single tissue sample, i.e. a single snapshot. Prospectively, this allows us to compare cell proliferation between individuals and identify abnormal stem cell dynamics, which affects the risk of stem cell related diseases.},

more spread out or dispersed than another. Here variability orderings
are considered that are preserved under conditioning on a common
subset. One density f on the real line is said to be less than or
equal to another, g, in uniform conditional variability order (UCVO)
if the ratio f(x)/g(x) is unimodal with the model yielding a supremum,
but f and g are not stochastically ordered. Since the unimodality
is preserved under scalar multiplication, the associated conditional
densities are ordered either by ucvo or by ordinary stochastic order.
If f and g have equal means, then UCVO implies the standard variability
ordering determined by the expectation of all convex functions. The
UCVO property often can be easily checked by seeing if f(x)/g(x)
is log-concave. This is illustrated in a comparison of open and closed
queueing network models.},

homolog of the equine herpesvirus-2 E10 gene: both contain an amino-terminal
caspase recruitment domain (CARD) homologous to that found in several
apoptotic molecules. Bcl10 and E10 activated NF-kappaB but caused
apoptosis of 293 cells. Bcl10 expressed in a MALT lymphoma exhibited
a frameshift mutation resulting in truncation distal to the CARD.
Truncated Bcl10 activated NF-kappaB but did not induce apoptosis.
Wild-type Bcl10 suppressed transformation, whereas mutant forms had
lost this activity and displayed gain-of-function transforming activity.
Similar mutations were detected in other tumor types, indicating
that Bcl10 may be commonly involved in the pathogenesis of human
malignancy.},

   abstract = {The in vitro proliferation kinetics of a cell line derived from a
patient with American Burkitt's lymphoma were investigated at three
different growth phases: lag (day 1), exponential (day 3) and plateau
(day 5). The growth curve, labeling and mitotic indices, percentage
labeled mitosis (PLM) curves and DNA content distributions were determined.
The data obtained have been analysed by the previously developed
discrete-time kinetic (DTK) model by which a time course of DNA distributions
during a 10-day growth period was characterized in terms of other
cell kinetic parameters. The mean cell cycle times, initially estimated
from PLM curves on days 1, 3 and 5, were further analysed by the
DTK model of DNA distributions and subsequently the mean cell cycle
times with respect to DNA distributions during the entire growth
period were determined. The doubling times were 39.6, 31.2 and 67.2
hr, respectively, at days 1, 3 and 5. The mean cell cycle time increased
from 23.0 to 37.7 hr from day 3 to day 5 mainly due to an elongation
of the G1 and G2 phases. A slight increase in the cell loss rate
from 0.0077 to 0.0081 fraction/hr was accompanied by a decrease in
the cell production rate from 0.0299 to 0.0184 fraction/hr. This
calculated cell loss rate correlated significantly with the number
of dead cells determined by trypan blue exclusion. Analysis of the
number of dead cells in relation to the cell cycle stage revealed
that a majority of cell death occurred in G1 (r + 0.908; P < 0.0001).
There was a good correlation between the in vitro proliferation kinetics
at plateau phase of this Burkitt's lymphoma derived cell line and
the in vivo proliferation kinetics of African Burkitt's lymphoma
(Iversen et al., 1974), suggesting the potential utility of information
obtained by in vitro kinetic studies.},

biological invasion remain poorly understood. Here, we consider the
epidemiological and evolutionary processes underlying the initial
introduction and subsequent spread of a pathogen in a new host population,
with special reference to pathogens that originate by jumping from
one host species to another. We conclude that, although pathogen
emergence is inherently unpredictable, emerging pathogens tend to
share some common traits, and that directly transmitted {RNA} viruses
might be the pathogens that are most likely to jump between host
species.},

   abstract = {The outcome of a major evolutionary transition is the aggregation of independent entities into a new synergetic level of organisation. Classical models involve either pairwise interactions between individuals or a linear superposition of these interactions. However, major evolutionary transitions display synergetic effects: their outcome is not just the sum of its parts. Multiplayer games can display such synergies, as their payoff can be different from the sum of any collection of two-player interactions. Assuming that all interactions start from pairs, how can synergetic multiplayer games emerge from simpler pairwise interaction? Here, we present a mathematical model that captures the transition from pairwise interactions to synergetic multiplayer ones. We assume that different social groups have different breaking rates. We show that non-uniform breaking rates do foster the emergence of synergy, even though individuals always interact in pairs. Our work sheds new light on the mechanisms underlying a major evolutionary transition.},

   abstract = {The karyotypes of cells from 10 Burkitt lymphoma (BL) biopsies, eight
cell lines established from BL and nine cell lines from non-BL sources
were studied by chromosome banding techniques. With the exception
of the BL-derived cell lines BJAB, GC-BJAB, Maku and U-8691 all biopsies
and lines of Burkitt origin contained an extra band at the distal
region of the long arm of one chromosome 14. An extra band on chromosome
14 was also found in cells of one non-BL biopsy, in cells from a
lymphosarcoma-derived cell line and in a long-established cell line
derived from the pleural exudate of a patient with Hodgkin's disease.
A distal region at the long arm of one chromosome 8 was missing in
all metaphase figures of good technical quality in the same material.
The size, morphology and stain-ability of the missing region corresponded
fairly well to the extra region at chromosome 14. We therefore suggest
that the chromosome 14 marker represents a translocation between
chromosomes 8 and 14,t (8q-; 14q+). The translocation was present
neither in lymphocytes of the peripheral blood of five Burkitt patients
nor in five lymphoblastoid cell lines of non-BL origin. Trisomy 7
was found in two of the 10 BL biopsies, in two BL-derived cell lines,
in one non-BL biopsy, in two lymphosarcoma-derived cell lines and
in one cell line derived from a patient with Hodgkin's disease.},

	abstract = {We consider interactions between players in groups of size d≥ 2 with payoffs that not only depend on the strategies used in the group but also fluctuate at random over time. An individual can adopt either cooperation or defection as strategy and the population is updated from one time step to the next by a birth-death event according to a Moran model. Assuming recurrent symmetric mutation and payoffs to cooperators and defectors according to the composition of the group whose expected values, variances, and covariances are of the same small order, we derive a first-order approximation for the average abundance of cooperation in the selection-mutation equilibrium. In general, we show that increasing the variance of any payoff for defection or decreasing the variance of any payoff for cooperation increases the average abundance of cooperation. As for the effect of the covariance between any payoff for cooperation and any payoff for defection, we show that it depends on the number of cooperators in the group associated with these payoffs. We study in particular the public goods game, the stag hunt game, and the snowdrift game, all social dilemmas based on random benefit b and random cost c for cooperation, which lead to correlated payoffs to cooperators and defectors within groups. We show that a decrease in the scaled variance of b or c, or an increase in their scaled covariance, makes it easier for weak selection to favor the abundance of cooperation in the stag hunt game and the snowdrift game. The same conclusion holds for the public goods game except that the variance of b has no effect on the average abundance of C. Moreover, while the mutation rate has little effect on which strategy is more abundant at equilibrium, the group size may change it at least in the stag hunt game with a larger group size making it more difficult for cooperation to be more abundant than defection under weak selection.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary game theory has been a successful tool to combine classical game theory with learning-dynamical descriptions in multiagent systems. Provided some symmetric structures of interacting players, many studies have been focused on using a simplified heuristic payoff table as input to analyse the dynamics of interactions. Nevertheless, even for the state-of-the-art method, there are two limits. First, there is inaccuracy when analysing the simplified payoff table. Second, no existing work is able to deal with 2-population multiplayer asymmetric games. In this paper, we fill the gap between heuristic payoff table and dynamic analysis without any inaccuracy. In addition, we propose a general framework for $m$ versus $n$ 2-population multiplayer asymmetric games. Then, we compare our method with the state-of-the-art in some classic games. Finally, to illustrate our method, we perform empirical game-theoretical analysis on Wolfpack as well as StarCraft II, both of which involve complex multiagent interactions.},

@article{Bloembergen:JAIR:2015,
	abstract = {The interaction of multiple autonomous agents gives rise to highly dynamic and nondeterministic environments, contributing to the complexity in applications such as automated financial markets, smart grids, or robotics. Due to the sheer number of situations that may arise, it is not possible to foresee and program the optimal behaviour for all agents beforehand. Consequently, it becomes essential for the success of the system that the agents can learn their optimal behaviour and adapt to new situations or circumstances. The past two decades have seen the emergence of reinforcement learning, both in single and multiagent settings, as a strong, robust and adaptive learning paradigm. Progress has been substantial, and a wide range of algorithms are now available. An important challenge in the domain of multi-agent learning is to gain qualitative insights into the resulting system dynamics. In the past decade, tools and methods from evolutionary game theory have been successfully employed to study multi-agent learning dynamics formally in strategic interactions. This article surveys the dynamical models that have been derived for various multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, making it possible to study and compare them qualitatively. Furthermore, new learning algorithms that have been introduced using these evolutionary game theoretic tools are reviewed. The evolutionary models can be used to study complex strategic interactions. Examples of such analysis are given for the domains of automated trading in stock markets and collision avoidance in multi-robot systems. The paper provides a roadmap on the progress that has been achieved in analysing the evolutionary dynamics of multi-agent learning by highlighting the main results and accomplishments.},

	abstract = {Across many domains of interaction, both natural and artificial, individuals use past experience to shape future behaviors. The results of such learning processes depend on what individuals wish to maximize. A natural objective is one's own success. However, when two such “selfish” learners interact with each other, the outcome can be detrimental to both, especially when there are conflicts of interest. Here, we explore how a learner can align incentives with a selfish opponent. Moreover, we consider the dynamics that arise when learning rules themselves are subject to evolutionary pressure. By combining extensive simulations and analytical techniques, we demonstrate that selfish learning is unstable in most classical two-player repeated games. If evolution operates on the level of long-run payoffs, selection instead favors learning rules that incorporate social (other-regarding) preferences. To further corroborate these results, we analyze data from a repeated prisoner's dilemma experiment. We find that selfish learning is insufficient to explain human behavior when there is a trade-off between payoff maximization and fairness.},

	abstract = {We examine how wealth inequality and diversity in the perception of risk of a collective disaster impact cooperation levels in the context of a public goods game with uncertain and non-linear returns. In this game, individuals face a collective-risk dilemma where they may contribute or not to a common pool to reduce their chances of future losses. We draw our conclusions based on social simulations with populations of independent reinforcement learners with diverse levels of risk and wealth. We find that both wealth inequality and diversity in risk assessment can hinder cooperation and augment collective losses. Additionally, wealth inequality further exacerbates long term inequality, causing rich agents to become richer and poor agents to become poorer. On the other hand, diversity in risk only amplifies inequality when combined with bias in group assortment—i.e., high probability that agents from the same risk class play together. Our results also suggest that taking wealth inequality into account can help to design effective policies aiming at leveraging cooperation in large group sizes, a configuration where collective action is harder to achieve. Finally, we characterize the circumstances under which risk perception alignment is crucial and those under which reducing wealth inequality constitutes a deciding factor for collective welfare.},
